amazon kindle fire has a lot of free app and can be used by any one that wants to get online anywhere,20
the echo show is a great addition to the amazon family works just like the echo but with a screen bright vibrant display rich clear sound works great with arlo security cameras excellent smart home addition just hope google and amazon start playing nice with each other soon so youtube will work again,20
great value from best buy bought at christmas sale,20
i use mine for email facebook games and to go on line i also have down loaded books i use it to take photos it is small and be taken easily i would recommend it to anyone,20
this is a fantastic item the person i bought it for loves it,20
this is a great devise for reading books or taking photos best buy associate was very helpful,20
i have enjoyed learning about home automation using echo plus and consumers need to know that this comes with having to buy additional equipment to get the most out of alexa,20
nice size very clear but randomly shuts off cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen if you watch video it buffers alot and laggs,20
awesome product and cool design and a great color i would recommend to a friend,20
love my mine works great with prime and i have all my best movies,20
our daughter loves her new tablet it has a bigger screen more features and she just enjoys being on it the kindle is priced right and is easy to use she was able to get her apps transferred to her new tablet in no time great investment,20
this a great tablet for everyone plenty of memory for downloading great features all around,20
as good as echo with added visuals can be usefuland fun,20
so my old kindle stopped working recently not sure why but it would not connect to our new router so i checked with best buy and saw they had kindle on sale for which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet i especially like that i can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light so far i have read books in the past months on this kindle and it flawless,20
my year old love to watch movies and this is perfect for him,20
we replaced and aging fire hdx she noticed the wifi connection is improved and the screen is larger she prefers this to my ipad air,20
i love the cameras and the video capabilities i have set up the picture albums and can even share on facebook and messenger i like the side charger much better than front i love the size too,20
needed a new kindle wasn t sure what one to choose this one is great,20
i have really enjoyed my new echo plus i enjoy music every morning with the news,20
this tablet is on the smaller side but works for me,20
i bought this for my wife and absolutely loves it alexa is so smart and helps my wife with everything like a personal assistant,20
needs to be a stand alone device i should have not required to use a tablet of cell phone to make it work amazon needs to work on the technology on device,20
this is the only one you need it s like having the dot echo and ihome all in one with a screen,20
this is a great tablet for the price i have one that i purchased a few years ago and use it much more than my laptop recently purchased two more for gifts,20
enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do initially disappointed by the small size but i quickly learned to appreciate it very portable and convenient i wanted something easy on the eyes with a g connection so i did not have to be connected to wifi to download books was a bit more then i wanted to pay but feel i will get good use out of it,20
i decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and i do not regret my decision at all the only con for those evaluating this as a tablet is that amazon has their own app store many apps from googleplay appstore are simply not available,20
i am using it for my year old and she loves it,20
great speaker and echo substitute this is great for on the go as a bluetooth speaker and when connected to the internet it works great using the alexa app,20
i bought this for my mom and she loves it she said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting it s easy for her to read,20
a bargain for the price especially for the coverage of the warranty a gift for my year old granddaughter things can happen to it she absolutely loves it and pretty easy to use,20
so far so good i enjoy being able to communicate with friends and family using the drop in feature,20
bought for year old grandaughter she loves it and now she won t need to steal moms tablet or phone,20
we the concept to learn and adapt to the ever changing word this product should stand out,20
no problems so far i m enjoying it suggestion it should come with some outputs plugs to connect it to bigger speakers sound system,20
i love my kindle it s perfect for reading my favorite books,20
got this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves that it is very convenient and easy to use,20
easy to use love the color and my daughter loves it easy to set up very happy with my purchase,20
this readeri is compact and fits nicely in my bag easy to use controls for children are very effective am glad i bought it,20
got it as a gift for my dad so far so good didn t not realise the special offers are ads spend more money to buy the one with out them also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection you now need wifi to connect to the store,20
i purchased this kindle fire hd was purchased for use by and yer old grandchildren they basically use it to play amazon games that you download,20
i bought the kindle oasis for my wife as a th anniversary gift she enjoys reading and i thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice she tried it for a few days and didn t care for it she writes notes in the margins and wasn t happy with the way the kindle did its notes for just reading i think it would be a very nice product,20
we bought one of these for our year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a christmas present for a year old parent it obviously isn t the highest quality tablet on the market but it very responsive and gets the job done and you can t beat the price just a great value,20
easy to set up we really enjoy getting real time local weather it translates spanish very efficiently we also enjoy the music we can easily select but would appreciate a higher quality sound linking the echo to lighting is a snap highly recommended,20
this tablet is great i loved the color and all the features it has i will be buying more for my daughters great purchase,20
i m new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use there s a decent amounts of apps at start up which can be good and bad,20
she is alexa better younger sister love her and some of the new skills great,20
i ve enjoyed using my fire hd tablet to play games,20
very easy to use and navigate my and year old grandsons can use them with ease some apps are limited as you do not have google play but there is plenty of games and learning games available,20
i bought my step mom an updated kindle she reads the new kindle more than her old one,20
i ve been using the original b n nook ereader for several years now i finally decided to upgrade i wish i d done it a lot sooner the new kindle touchscreen ereader is phenomenal the device is light and easy to carry almost unbelievably so it is fast and responsive and touch screen has delay i would recommend anybody in the market for this one buy one immediately you won t regret it,20
exchanged the google google home for this model fun for the kids finding new uses for it every day had a problem when best buy forgot to include the free light bulb,20
love this kindle the press side page turner is great,20
alexa is amazing and the phillips bulb works seamlessly with it,20
it has very limited use without adding on expensive apps or adding more wireless speakers i am considering returning the merchandise,20
information on weather updates on music events fun questions answered while working in kitchen good sound for a limited areagreat sales assistance at best buy,20
the grandkids love this tablet easy for them to use,20
bought as gift for my granddaughter who is she loves it plays games watches videos and listens to music,20
it was good works pretty easily the camera is good,20
fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the,20
this is great product the tablet are made tough and great price,20
this tablet is not only a great price but exactly what i needed for quick internet access and to download books,20
if amazon and google can work things out the show will be amazing we already loved the echo and the dot and were looking forward to adding video unfortunately youtube is no longer on the show limiting the video content if they can ever get it back the show will definitely be a star product,20
the family and i love alexa view and once we got it we were hooked now everything in the house and outside is run by voice commands the opportunities with this are endless,20
bought for my wife to upgrade from the original kindle that she has worn out big step up from the original and should be good for another years,20
i have dots and an echo and this just sounds better and looks better,20
was not hard to set up and love the quality good screen size and clarity,20
i bought shows and i am loving them them video flash briefing are wonderful and personalized i don t have to keep my phone on me to keep in touch with my closest family members they can just drop in and i can do the same with the kids when away from the house i made more purchases immediately after to put them in my office and living room i love the lyrics when music is playing and looking at the forecast on the fly they are a must have for a modern home,20
i really enjoy my fire stick it s really easy to use,20
excellent speaker love the portability and long lasting battery before a recharge is needed a very good digital assistant and lots of fun to use,20
this new fire tablet with gb of internal memory is an upgrade from my older gb version allowing more storage of books movies and apps,20
great product user friendly and can t be beaten for the promotion prices,20
this tablet does a great deal from surfing the net to watching movie and using all of the music channels this is an affordable way to stay in touch also i use it for ebooks for school,20
we love alexa great addition to our family lol but seriously you can rely on alexa,20
purchased this item for our daughter she absolutely loves it,20
great inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps,20
i am pleasantly surprised at how well this works i bought the e reader and it didn t work so i was nervous buying this kindle but it works great and my son loves it,20
great device and easy setup the ease of use for the kids are also great,20
love the new fire great for books games and getting online easy to use features and perfect size screen to take on the go,20
this was a christmas present the person that received it was very happy with it she has other kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones,20
great resolution easy to use amazon prime gives you free movies books and games,20
amazon built upon the success of their echo i m really enjoying the convenience of the echo with the added display,20
this tablet is great for kids i bought it for my grandson and he is delighted with it he uses it constantly,20
i just love this tap it is so much fun the music is so great i play the relation music every night every night best thing ever,20
i can t update facebook and a few other apps it s not what i expected,20
i didon t care for this tablet downloading apps outside of amazon was really confusing,20
best item i ever use i would love to get another one,20
i didn t actually use as i bought for a gift my grandson already had one so we returned for a pair if d goggles,20
this tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality,20
purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year amazon membership the recipient loves it and says it performs very well as a past amazon fire user now i pad graduate i loved my amazon fire for more than years without any problems in fact i just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ,20
biting as a gift my only concern was the size and the amazon interface it was easy enough to download the google play store so it was familiar to the user size was an initial concern but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome,20
i understood it did not have the wake command but it would be better if it had it other than that everything is wonderful with this speaker really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps just ask alexa and she plays the most recent episode,20
my yr old grand daughter loves her new tablet now she can watch mickey clubhouse whenever she wants,20
for a cheap starter tablet it s fine bought it to replace a cheaper kids tablet and it ll do for that,20
love this tablet power lasts long short charge time hd screen is really clear only con is that there are some apps not available like google play very satified have a gb card in mine plenty of space for downloads the camera has no flash and is not the best but i didnt buy this tablet for that high recommend the hd tablet gb amazon fire you want go wrong,20
this was a perfect tablet for my year old it does everything that she needed it to,20
simple great buy for your money if you are an avid reader,20
sound quality is very good sleek design is nice,20
i love to read books books books and more books,20
makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that i can see a whole page at one time the protective cover that best buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the on off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that i had to find another cover from another source,20
this was a gift for my kids they love them easy to use and lots of great apps,20
product is great it is easy to use and easy to set up,20
i bought this for learning and entertaining purposes my daughter is enjoys it i compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price protection plan this works best for us,20
like the fact that i can see videos and utilize ir with my lighting system,20
purchased for my mom in a memory care center she doesn t have to answer the phone we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us picture clarity awesome staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently doesn t replace room camera but good would give a but can t figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her anyone know,20
purchased this for year old boy and couldn t be happier,20
i am loving my amazon echo show it makes life easier i love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking alexa i also love being able to video call friends and family that have an echo show or the alexa app overall it is a great product,20
this kindle fire is lighter than my old one the speed is great all apps load very quickly i also like that it comes in different colors,20
the kids will have a lot of fun time with games and learning,20
this has quickly become one of the most used at the kitchen counter if you have alexa an you like it a must have upgrade,20
i had an older version of a kindle e reader that allowed me to download books on the go but i felt like something was missing several upgrades later i got this for a gift and i think it basically includes everything that was missing it is so lightweight and compact that i can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand it has backlighting that doesn t disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting it s just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths it can self adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day,20
the graphics and sound on this tablet were better than expected,20
i got oasis yesterday very lighweight compared to voyager screen size comparable like having actual page turn button touchscreen seems kinda slow the on off button on top is improvement from back of voyager cover does seem kind of flimsy but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up finding it easier to hold with cover on then removed cover doesn t have separate charge port so all charging is done thru kindle,20
got it for few weeks but it kind of fades away from your life,20
i bought this tablet for my year old daughter too many advertisements i would rather pay more and not have a single ad,20
we were interested in the echo line of products after we purchased our vivint security system the echo show is a perfect addition we are able to view our security cameras from the the echo show and it works great in general as an echo with all its features,20
this is a great tablet for kids as it is not too expensive and there is a year warranty if it breaks within years they replace it my year is very rough with things my husband was letting him plug the charger in by himself and jammed it into the tablet causing the charging port to break i had no problems getting it replaced,20
i absolutely love my kindle i go nowhere without it it has kept me entertained for hours don t have to keep up with books that get torn or lost i would and do recommend a kindle for everyone,20
i really enjoy the sound it sounds so full my only disappointment is the limited functionality of the built in hub i had to purchase the hue hub to get full functionality other than that i love it,20
i love it easy to use many different features,20
i have had kindles over the years got to have one to read my books relax,20
alexa is amazin i love the features their great just love it,20
video integration it s big plus for video calling kids at home and quick check who s at the door when doorbell rings,20
having amazon echos i had to pick up these to add to more rooms these work best in the bedroom or kitchen video display is bright video calling is a great addition and is flawlessly get them when they go on sale,20
the color is what got me and the features was on point the screen shows a lot of different displays to share for now until the next one,20
i love this product and it was one of my best buy s from best buy,20
i love it it works great i love the drop in func,20
this is my first tablet love it actually read my first e book on it large screen easy to read play games fits nicely in my purse,20
upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras sound is much better,20
with the cover attached the battery lasts for a good long period with the cover detached which is how i use it primarily the oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand the ability to switch hands flip upside down means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book and it fits into my pants pocket again perfect for traveling the battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days but i tend to reconnect the cover at night i am assuming that helps to recharge the basic oasis battery regardless it was well worth replacing our older kindle readers with the newer oasis we bought two,20
great tablet perfect for my year old son,20
good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn,20
like it better then the nabi jr more like a real tablet actually it is with the extra protective case,20
i don t know why i waited so long to bring alexa into my home it s how i listen to my music now dictate my shopping and to do lists and get my morning weather report just to name a few i highly recommend this item,20
this was a great tablet for the price for my wife perfect size and good for traveling,20
got this as a gift for my sister and her fianc and they love it works great with phillips hue,20
i purchased this kindle fire for my husband and he loves it he had an older model which he loved but my dog accidentally broke it this updated version has so many new features which he loves,20
i got this for my two grandsons ages for christmas they love them,20
i had always been looking to upgrade my original kindle i love the new touch features and display on this one the size also makes it very easy to transport,20
i wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format the fire meets my needs at a great price,20
no problem other than setup took a few minutes to finish,20
it would be nice to have full app library but it does what you need,20
the new design is lighter has a longer battery life and the page displays are crisp and clear the light adapts to the environment you are reading in to keep the image consistent the new kindle voyage is amazing,20
i gave my paperwhite to a friend and bought the voyage i like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages i don t know that it s really worth all of the extra cost compared to the paperwhite especially since the new one just came out with dpi,20
i bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently she loves it and uses it all the time,20
very impressed set up a little confusing but overall a good experience still learning however best buy emails give away any gift secrets had to reset my account to a work email address,20
she love it she said it easy to use she love it very much,20
this is my third kindle and the best one yet love the new controls the backlit page the compact size and the ease of use i would recommend the kindle voyage to all readers,20
we got this for the whole family and we are absolutely love the alexa speaker,20
everything i expected with none of the drawbacks i have found in other tablets,20
bought this as a surprise gift and the recipient loves it,20
it s ok but i rather have bought samsung galaxy tab,20
this is my third kindle the best differentiator is the form factor definite improvement over the paperwhite also like having the page turn buttons back case is very cool indeed if you can get past the jump in price remember you re not having to buy the case separately it s a quality product to have,20
i never used kindle before my wife gifted me on my birthday this is the amazing product i am using it for daily reading the display is fantastic and no strain on eyes,20
the apps are better it charges faster and the camera is really neat,20
it has been wonderful i bought it for my boyfriend but i get more use out of it then he does,20
i think the amazon fire offer should include a stand cover as standard i enjoy mine a lot more since i was forced to purchase a stand cover which holds the tablet would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use,20
i found the amazon fire hd to be very easy to travel back and forth to school i can easily transfer my work in class to my main computer at home,20
i bought this as a gift so i haven t gotten to use it much yet the initial setup was really easy and i am sure that she is going to love it,20
very satisfied with product as do my family kids,20
i bought it for my son in laws birthday after they bought me one for christmas not just good for music but helpful for grandkids homework and now we can video chat with grandkids which the one year old loves,20
this is a great tablet for kids and adults alike,20
i had some thoughts about getting this for a year old but if you get the screen protector and a case i feel it will last a long time,20
this is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading,20
easy to use and elegant in design perfect gift for kids,20
i bought this as a gift for christmas and it was well liked,20
i haven t used this yet it is a gift for my father but i think he ll love it,20
i needed a simple tablet to use in my car on long trips bought two of these and boy do they deliver the best tablets for this price the kindle book reader is an added bonus the finishing is good my kids love it,20
love my amazon echo show however i wish alexa knew a little bit more,20
purchased for my father in law this was the most frustrating experience not user friendly not friendly at all stick with a name brand tablet apple samsung etc avoid this device at all costs,20
my nd fire great picture quality easy to use would recommend for all ages,20
recently divorced i bought of these tonserve as homebase for me and my year old it has helped him to know there is one spot in both our houses he can reach me by simply saying drop on daddy,20
easy to set up but it does not work with all phones i have samsung,20
this fire worked great but i returned it because it was not the one i wantedbest buy took it back for a full refund with no problems best buy is alsome,20
i love my kindle i m back to reading so much more often as i always have several books with me at all times at first it surprised me that this version doesn t have a back light and you need a light to read but i actually like it now as i don t get the eye strain like i do when using my phone,20
we purchased the amazon echo show with alexa in store took it home and after connection wi fi it was great we cannot wait to buy light bulbs and a thermostat great buy,20
my son is a huge fan of it and i love that i can control what he watches and plays,20
this was a gift for christmas we bought this on a black friday sale price was reasonable,20
i bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale i ve been pleasantly surprised search sounds great for its size,20
bought this for all four of my children and they loved it,20
bought for my kids and they love them they love the camera,20
in my opinion this model is too small and feels cheap and sd card slot,20
this replaced my old kindle fire i have not yet explored all of the features but so far it is performing very well tablet is a good size and weight and easy to use,20
got this for my year old granddaughter and she loves it uses it for game play homework etc mom and dad loves the parental controls not having to worry so much,20
i m very happy with my purchase i bought one because my wife has one and is very happy with hers,20
we bought this for our son who wanted nothing for christmas he uses it all the time with lights music and locking the door he absolutely loves it we are now buying another home base for the rest of the house,20
what is there to say but that i love it functions well and lasts a long time,20
it is good to have this as a backup lags performance eventually not worth for the money,20
great product i m at the beginning stages of having a smart home and this was the perfect addition,20
almost a week late from release date from ups but finally got this and set it up which was easy once in a while it doesn t hear you right but that s probably due to being feet away with the tv on other than that no problems,20
we bought this reader to replace a fire hdx that had seemed to go wonky turns out a couple of system resets and the hdx is back to normal so i get the old one she gets the new one but i can highly recommend this reader the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent,20
using it in my kitchen the whole family has access and we can all use different functionality great for looking up recipies music and calling relatives or friends,20
little putsy so far but there are continuous updates that i think will make this a great device to stay connected with family bought a second for my dad who knows he might replace his land line someday if this gets better i do think our original echo is a bit better at responding but i enjoy this one in the kitchen aka hub of the house,20
i purchased as a gift for father in law and he loves it,20
i bought this tablet to replace one i had different brand that was worn out this is a pretty good tablet for the price i just wanted something to use til i could get something bigger i ve had no problems with it other than some of the games i played on my other one not being available on the fire,20
i bought two of these one for my son and the other for nephew they love it i downloaded kidsmode on it and all their educational games they can play besides regular games,20
having fun with all the things we can learn from alexa it is almost like having another person in the house,20
i purchased this tablet and am very happy with it,20
you need to have amazone prime in order to have music,20
slower than my last kindle the power button is not easy accesible when in a case,20
bought this tablet on sale i can look up all the things i m interested in,20
gift for great nephew have that are and y o both love these tablets because each got one play with them as much as mom allows,20
definitely worth the money the sound is awesome,20
i bought two tablets for you little ones and they love them i would recommend,20
love how it hooks up to lights and can play any music,20
i got this as a spur of the moment thing i figured it was going to be super gimmicky but was pleasantly surprised that it s actually a very helpful device for organizing shopping smart home control listening to music or even watching some videos while i m washing dishes my show is in my kitchen and i ve used it for countless things i think this is amazon s best alexa yet,20
great tablet for price display is clear enjoy books on tablet,20
sound is amazing wish alexa knew more things i get a lot of i m sorry i don t know that which is unfortunate,20
bought this to carry around for internet and gaming so far very happy,20
we brought this as a replacement for the fifteen to fifty books my daughter wanted to take with her to hawaii books of course would weigh a lot and there be no room for cloths pesky airline and their poundage issues now she can take a hundred books and she has a mini computer it s a win win but no win for the airlines,20
the battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge i bought the fire in july and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it i am not impressed and would not repurchase it,20
i was very impressed with the functionality of my amazon echo very useful to have around the house and for the discounted price it a steal,20
i bought this for my daughter it s a little limited in what it can do but she loves it she s a little too young to understand the games but she loves watching cartoons on it,20
can not tell you the price of merchandise when asked,20
purchased due to reviews and in sale so far easy to use,20
this device meets the needs of my grandson he can read and play games on it it also has the parental safeguards,20
i bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints,20
bought this tablet for my grandson and we couldn t be happier he loves it and it is easy to use created the children s account so he wouldn t be distracted by all the other goings on the internet bought this so he could play games do his school work as it links up nicely to the ixl and google class love the usage timer and the ability to lock it down i have loaded the google play store on it so we now access to many games and other apps no issues so far great buy for the money only down side i can see or in this case hear so far low sounding speaker could be a bit louder or better placed all in all you wont be disappointed in this purchase great for web page looks ups reading and playing games,20
loved the fire hd but the latest hd is sharper faster and still handles great,20
i bought the white version and have it in the kitchen i use it for everything music video phone security cams news weather it s the perfect kitchen assistant,20
this tablet is perfect for travel recently took it on a trip and the battery lasted the entire day with watching shows on and off on netflix great first tablet,20
i m in love with alexa love her fir music quick weather updates and in the kitchen for recipes it s great getting them step by step and not having to keep putting the passcode in on my ipad with hands covered in flour,20
not too satisfied with the sound and it loses bluetooth connection no matter what phone i use either iphone or android,20
absolutely love the echo show it is in my kitchen i love seeing my to do and shopping lists on there my calendar is there too plus i scroll pictures on it from my amazon prime photos love being able to get the daily news briefing from mpr every morning also use it for timing things would highly recommend it to amazon prime members got it at a great price on sale prior to christmas,20
bestbuy delivered this on the day of release amazon still seems to be back ordered it is a great product nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance,20
nice upgrade from my old kindle i like it very much,20
kid friendly great appschild can learn many things with this tablet,20
i love this tablet for kids it s so much fun for them great buy,20
love the look love the size love that it is visual,20
great tablet for streaming good internet connection along with a nice display,20
other similar devices do not have the voice recognition learning capability the echo plus has it is superior to all the others,20
the kids love it they ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer i really like for the music aspect just tell it a song and it finds it,20
this is my th kindle and is easily the best one i ve ever had it is very comfortable to hold and is very compact i was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles it may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery,20

i love it it can do it all beautiful color graphics and in no time at all i can watch a movie or play games or read my favorite novel i love it,20

this is a good tablet for my son to use to play his games,20
looks nice can t wait to try it out great price for a tablet,20
it was just as described i would recommend it to a friend,20
when you can get this thing on sale it s an amazing deal have all of your amazon features right in your face books manga gaming amazon it s easy to hold has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen sure the galaxy tablets have better specs but it s the price and features you get from amazon that make this device amazing,20
needed a tv in our kitchen wasn t looking for huge or fancy for this so the inch was perfect for us,20
very happy and satisfiedeasier to handle fast charging,20
i love my new amazon fire tablet it s great the perfect size to fit in my purse so that i can take it with me i would definitely recommend to a friend,20
love alexa it works so well speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does,20
i bought this tablet for my year old grand daughter and she loves it we set the parental controls for her age group and now we don t have to worry about what she is doing on it we downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it and now she has her own little private movie theater it also works great with our amazon fire tv and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows this is a great buy for the money and i recommend it to everyone,20
this is an awesome product i also own a paperwhite if you always read in good lighting i would recommend you save some money and buy this instead of the paperwhite,20
i love that this tablet came preloaded all we needed to do was charge it and my child had access to many books at an appropriate level,20
very good price good item would purchase again this was a gift,20
the system is able to react quickly to the verbal directions it even is able to pickup voices across the room and seems to capture the commands accurately even when spoken quickly,20
purchased this for my son has room to upgrade memory to allow more books games but the speakers could be better or located in a better position,20
i love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can t get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which i don t because i have a four and year old there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups,20
i would recommend this product it works great and ver compact,20
i wanted a speaker to listen to pandora and go so much more being able to speak to alexa and get news weather timer light controls and so much more love the product,20
i am so glad that i bought this echo it has made it easier to automate my music and my lights throughout my house we are still learning to use it but hope to add our thermostat as well to the items i can control with my alexa,20
its a great product but for the cost the speakers are not what they should be and the screen is too small choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot i am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance,20
this is the hub dollar my smart devices and it worksthis is the hub dollar my smart devices and it works,20
not a substitute for an ipad but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage,20
meh it works i find it difficult to navigate i also have an ipad mini this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad,20
bought two of these one for the living room and one for the bedroom great when you dont feel like walking to the living room and need to talk to your significant other honestly dont use it much but when i do its great music shopping stupid questions movie times etc,20
i bought this second kindle for the larger storage space and love all the extra stuff i can do now,20
the ease of use and comparability with smart home products make a this an awesome product,20
this is my th kindle and is easily the best one i ve ever had it is very comfortable to hold and is very compact i was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles it may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery,20
i read a huge number of books in kindle format this kindle fire is perfect for that it s just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying it also is great for audible users you will want to install a micro sd card though you can also use it to watch netflix and the like although i don t as a tablet it leaves a lot to be desired if you are looking for a tablet give this a pass it has a lot of system lag and wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal also you should know that you can t access any apps on the google play store it s locked into amazon none of that bothers me because like i said i only use it to read listen to kindle books and this device works perfectly for that bottom line if you just want a kindle reading platform with some extra functionality this will work well for you if you re looking for the full android tablet experience look elsewhere,20
my echo show is my christmas gift to myself so far i am having great fun with this nifty new addition to my amazon family of home monitoring devices i have connected the show to my ring doorbell,20
when used with amazon prime and the freetime app for kids this is a great tablet recommend installing at least gb of micro sd card storage and install apps to the card to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos easy enough to use for our year old grandson,20
this is a low cost item that provides huge returns for the money spent it is a great little tablet,20
family is having fun with alexa i do like the way it integrates with other devices around the home arlo nest,20
i love the the ability to video chat and watch videos on how to do stuff,20
i bought several alexa s for christmas gifts also for myself also bought amazon show for christmas gift also for a my youngest daugter,20
you have the ability to set up on and off times for your child s profile the apps are good and adults can use it as well because you can have multiple password protected profiles on the tablet at once this was perfect for my five year old on a five thousand mile plus plane trip,20
this is an awesome product this is the first echo product i owned and i purchased to get off i was going to split with a friend but like this so much that i decided to keep both i ve being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos the videos on youtube takes a more effort to find the ones i want but i think this will improve over time,20
just installed but like it so far the picture is clear and the price is affordable,20
the amazon echo plus is good buy it buy it you will love it,20
great product but the only downside is that it did not work with my home security camera,20
this is my third one of these and this is the best one by far,20
just a simple kindle doesn t have the glass back,20
my sons love playing on their tablet not only does it allow me additional time to get things done but they enjoy the educational apps provided,20
my kids loved it they were able to learn how to use it right away,20
this is great for kids it grows up with them all the apps are good my kid loves it,20
works well with smart home lights door locks and wireless security cam,20
we bought this as a christmas gift for our year old he loves it it s durable and reliable,20
love my kindle at the price it is the best value in tech right now,20
i bought this tablet for my grandson and he absolutely loves it,20
bought this for my grandson the first one had issues and best buy exchanged it my grandson loves it,20
she hasn t used the it yet but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine,20
my daughter loves her kindle and it s larger than the previous one she had she enjoys it,20
my husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home he likes to have shows and movies to watch this has so much space for him to download things to watch,20
my kiddo loves this tablet she s and knows how to work it well i look at it sometimes and see apps that i didn t download lol good thing first year is free it s very durable as well great product overall i would ve liked a different color for her but blue was all that was in stock and i got it a great price being on sale plus i had certificates to use,20
i received an original echo two years ago and use it in my office this year i decided to get one for the house and was amazed at all the features i hadn t taken advantage of primarily the smart home features this was great because it came with a lightbulb,20
can use many differents apps from the echo show awesome product,20
happy with the purcase gift for my mother in law,20
amazon s devices get better and better each release i ve had the original kindle fire and it s in no way an apple ipad replacement but what it does it does better than anyone it s a perfect starter tablet and perfect for a child the price keeps you from worrying about drops and the interface is easy to use,20
i bought it xmas for my yr old who always wants our iphones to watch utube videos it s cool looking and well made plus alexa is helpful it she still prefers our iphones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive i like it but don t live it,20
i love my smart portable speaker it has games weather news podcasts radio stations etc if something is missing i can connect my bluetooth phone and stream whatever other audio application i want,20
the original electronic book bought it for my wife who reads paper book at two to three a week she s hooked and loves the kindle,20
this kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach,20
love everything about my new tablet good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails,20
great tablet lag free when running apps good battery life only downside is lack of ability to screen mirror was available on older versions but no longer,20
i purchased a echo for home so added a tap for my office at work so i can chat with alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent bt speaker for my office this has great sound streaming my prime music and xm vis the xm app can t go wrong quality music and alexa when i need some help with spelling hard word s she getting smart pick one up you have a woman to talk to when the wife is out,20
omg i am so enjoying this sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn t require plugs or wires saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet best buy play it now everyday,20
hard to use and does not support guam online instructions not clear,20
purchased this for my fiance s youngest son for christmas and also to replace his broken no name handheld he loved it the speed ease of use and size were perfect for him he mostly uses it for music youtube and instagram all of which seem to work fine on it it was also very affordable he s happy with it so we are too,20
this product is easy to use and take along with you,20
i bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit i set it up with her as the user entered her age and name and now amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age simple to do and she loves the capabilities i also bought and installed a gig sd card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage for the price i think this tablet is best one out there you can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost,20
this tablet is great and easy to use very convenient and handy to have around,20
better than nook also cheaper if toy areally looking to use as a tablet not the best choice great for reading and basic searching,20
my and year old download their own games easy to set up and get working thanks to parental control i know what they are downloading,20
great bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of alexa,20
i use this hours a day whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo device the battery life sound quality and voice recognition is great,20
replacement tablet for my wife no complaints she watches netflix on it a lot,20
i have an original gen echo that has been relocated to my bedroom by simply unplugging and plugging back in now that i have the gen echo plus in my living room and set up to work seamlessly with my gen i could not be happier along with the built in hue it makes it that much better everything works just like i want and the sound on both devices are perfect for me,20
this has a lot of good features to limit the amount of time and what is accessed,20
product is good light amazing battery backup i charge the kindle one in weeks great product for reasonable price usb connection is easy books are easy to download overall everyone must have kindle with them and this is the best product model to start with understandably this is the beginner level model for people who never used kindle before features like led lights white paper background are not available on this model these features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in dark without lights but again for this price you would not get any other good readers if you are someone who reads in dark then i would suggest go for higher kindle models,20
fantastic sound from such a small speaker excellent not as impressed with its other potential capabilities more difficult to set those up get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather order items etc wish it came with more pre installed i guess,20
great item to upgrade your house works very well,20
nice little tablet with great features bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book she also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on,20
good for beginners play games take picture and recording videos old the time,20
i have never owned a tablet wanted an i pad like most but couldn t afford the sticker price this one fit my needs perfect i mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video no complaints so far i would recommend this device,20
i bought this as a backup i am currently using the same headphone,20
whats to say it s kindlelishous,20
i bought this tablet for my two yr old granddaughter for christmas and she loves the games and camera works great glad i got it for her,20
i bought this for reading listening books love the availability to expand the memory now i can load movies and tons of books,20
not much to say here cheap fast and very functional i was able to install google play store and everything works perfectly best tablet in its category if you want something better you better be ready to pay times the price,20
i brought my tube amplifier to best buy and my magnolia rep hooked it up to a pair of b w series speakers wow it sounded like etta james was right in the room fantastic,20
i love my kindle it is user friendly and there s so much more than i thought,20
currently setting everything up on it but so far so good,20
gets use everyday by my girlfriend who i bought it for with no complaints also love the color also may get one for myself,20
this was a purchase for christmas great tablet to surf the web or read books on would recommend for any age,20
easy to use no complains at all added all the smart plugs to the skills and works perfect,20
great tablet for web access and works well gaming no reason to spend more unless you need a larger screen,20
i lie the size and weight for the kindle makes it very convenient to take large books with me in digital format,20
i like the echo show i can view my cams watch a movie and read the news the camera video is slightly delayed and i do wish it had a jack for earphones but the sound on mine is good,20
i bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son it s fast and easy to use,20
i had a very small nano and needed to have more space for songs that are just coming out and so far i love it didn t really need the bigger one because i have a phone that will do most of those things,20
this tablet is so great for school children to play and learn on,20
i ve had other kindles and when my current ones storage became low i knew i wanted to purchase another one it can be used for a variety of uses,20
unable to try light bulb because it would not hook to echo plus waiting for rest of system,20
i wasn t offer the warranty but i enjoy it a lot,20
great tablet for the price we have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids this is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids,20
i like that the tablet has child settings and time usage very helpful in setting time limits,20
this is an upgrade tablet from my first kindle fire that i purchased years ago love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads the great hd visuals and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred accessed by this new device love that this fire has a front and rear camer too my old fire only had a front facing camera granted this is not an ipad but i don t want or need all an ipad does and i definitely don t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool my fire tablet does everything i need or want and it costed under i am one satisfied and pleased customer,20
this is a nice and inexpensive tablet great for reading on or looking up info on the internet only downfall is you can t download some online games onto it,20
limited apps and a bit thicker than ipad but works,20
i purchased this tablet for my year old son and he loves it great for movies games and reading books online definetly would recommend it as a starter tablet for young children the hard protective cover is a plus,20
i have of these in my house work great i just bought for christmas gifts for my family,20
this product was purchased for my grandson he had a fire he however loves the hd he uses it for music gaming mostly great electronic device,20
i can play games surf the internet or watch movies i can check my e mail or just about do anything i can do on a regular computer i strongly recommend it,20
i purchased a kindle a few years ago and have loved the flexibility it give me i can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer i love the fact that i can continue to read my books while i travel doctor office visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because i can ignore the office chatter and the tv selections i rather not watch i encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that this is my second purchase love it,20
bought of these for christmas for my family members i ve had mine for a year in my kitchen and just love it so much you can do with it and works great with my arlo pro cameras big plus amazon is always updating the show to do more,20

bought this kindle for my grandson he loves it and it very easy to use,20
a great value and i love it sounds great and works,20
purchased this to get a lighter tablet also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery this is all around lighter thinner and easier to handle hd is a good upgrade and can t beat the price for comparable tablets with same features my wife reads on it daily and loves it i am probably going to search for another one we have the and i would like to try a if it were available i like to try different size devices to see how i adjust same way with todays phones,20
great learning tool for my granddaughter she loves it,20
alexa with screen love it works perfectly with my ring doorbell,20
plan to buy a second a second amazon kindle for a hi e year old,20
it is nice to have access to the features this offers,20

i got this for a really good price i already had the echo dot that i was kind of unimpressed with i love the echo show there are so many more things to do and the sound quality is great,20
this has been a very nice addition it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it,20
i use this every day on my commute great battery life no backlight but very readable with normal lighting i like the built in dictionary email yourself pdf or mobi files for easy transfers,20

you can do some many things and the best part apps for free on amazon underground,20
my grandson really enjoys his new kindle that he for for a christmas present,20
bought a few kindles in the past but this time one of it came defective the port was bent and it was hard to charge but still possible comes in different color was gb enough space for kids has camera ok quality not the best but ok for pics taken by kids,20
i picked this up after purchasing an echo i wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my echo i use both devices mostly for music it s great to be able to hear pandora or my amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone laptop etc i can just grab the tap and go anywhere in my house outside to the deck anywhere that i my wireless will reach,20
very satisfied with this purchase my grandson loved it,20
its a lot more then we expected this is a wonderful addition to our tech life,20
small and easy to use for children when traveling,20
i bought it for my fianc and he can t get enough of it awesome purchase,20
i use it for everything mainly as my new alarm clock cant wait for them to open it up even more,20
my only dislike is that being a kindle my kindle books cannot be sorted into categories it s harder to find new books i ve downloaded some time ago when i have to search through all of them,20
good tablet for a yr old at first was not interested and still not but bought in in case and maybe one day if they decided to use it on a road trip good product for the price,20
great tablet for my yr old love the profile options and parental controls,20
i was using the original echo seldomly then i decided to get the show i use the show a lot more was simple to set up and you can make calls with video great product,20
love it works great one in each of the main rooms,20
have been using this item and it seems to be working quite well,20
once the games are downloaded it was great for long road trips,20
i like being able to ask about the weather set an alarm on my phone or create a shopping list all by just asking elexia,20
i bought this as a gift for my husband and he is constantly asking alexa questions about everything we love listening to music on it as well,20
i m normally an apple snob but needed a cheap tablet and was very surprised how functional the amazon fire is,20
she loves it the only problem i have is getting it away from her even while riding in vehicles lol,20
was gift fot my daughter she seems to enjoy very much,20
purchased after theft in seattle it was on sale and works great,20
if nothing else i have peace of mind that should she fall or need assistance then i can now better assist,20
the tablet is very light and streams well i only use it to stream movies and it s much ligher then an ipad so makes mobility that much better,20
the kindle is amazing this is my second one the price was misleading however as i had to pay something like another extra bucks to get rid of the ads just know that,20
we already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter they are a good learning tool,20
tablet has worked without a hitch we bought it for my father who is just shy of with a couple of instructions he s been using it without further assistance,20
i bought this for my daughter for christmas i could set her as a user and make it safe for her age i downloaded books and apps with ease i m glad that she is loving her fire,20
this tablet does a great deal from surfing the net to watching movie and using all of the music channels this is an affordable way to stay in touch also i use it for ebooks for school,20
do you spend lots of time on amazon do you like listening to music anywhere in your home this is the device for you even after a month of having the tap i m still learning what all i can do with it verbally play genre of music in the huge amazon library i even have ordered items directly from it one last feature i want to share is that it provides accurate weather information current and forecast up to a week,20
i love to use alexa to listen to music set timer alarms and ect my parents use the show to show the cameras and stuff for a second control panel to their security system,20
outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced ipad,20
this is just perfect for my year old nothing fancy parental control is a bit confusing but i got it now the case is perfect to keep it safe just get a sd card for extra memory,20
with a seamless integration and easy functionality the echo show is wonderful piece of tech that is entertaining and useful to the whole family,20
we got this for our yr old daughter and its perfect for her there hasn t been any issue with the games and educational apps she uses,20
nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better,20
this tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children,20
i bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices my mother bought him a subscription to the abc mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on at first i was skeptical about spending the extra for the kids fire as i thought it was mainly for the case which i thought to be cheap silicon when the tablet arrived in the mail i was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick heavy duty type of foam it provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops it booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child s account the child s account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don t want them to get a hold of you can set time limits on their account to your desire you can allow and disallow any application you want to their account it comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited which i interpreted as basically prime for kids this allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want the kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate he is able to one click to any apps books games he wants to use it also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top overall i m very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the internet holds if you re not careful,20
the amazon fire hd is one of the best deals on the market i ve had a ipad and would rather have the hd it s what of the price of a ipad and just as good if not better,20
this is not like other android tablets in a bad way,20
got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked cheaper than getting the screen replaced,20
bought for husband to replace his old one uses it all the time and would recommend,20
i debated on what tablet reader to buy and decided on the fire i have been very pleased with it bought it on sale what a great price,20
my brother told me about this product i bought it for my son and he loves it,20
amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far the only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don t have to tap every command that would make it a star device,20
bought it for my son wife they love it both thought they didn t need it they find that it is a lot of fun and very useful,20
got this for my year old daughter and her and my three year old love it lightweight durable and loaded with books and games what really sold me on this one over the other options was the year anything guarantee that amazon offers,20
i love this thing it s so fun and easy to use my year old even uses it to play the trolls or lion king soundtrack,20
this thing works great i would recommend to all of my friends should have bought one sooner we listen to music non stop now,20
great sound and amazing options love this great replacement for original echo,20
i got this tablet on a deal and has good quality of video you can watch,20
thoroughly enjoy my new show love the scrolling pictures,20
with a price tag of this is one of the low end tablets with a lot of features but is certainly worth its price tag but it definitely lacks the features and hd display of its high end variant fire hd,20
works well we had one of the original fires and it finally died which is why we bought another great clarity and better internet also,20
i wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick i ll get flowers next time,20
it was easy to set up and use best buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features,20
this tablet has many educational games for a preschooler,20
i love the echo alexa is awesome it was a christmas present also received two dots to place in other rooms,20
bought this for my teenage daughter and it works beautifully with great battery life,20
i wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick i ll get flowers next time,20
this is the main reason why i went with amazon s echo ecosystem vs google home i bought one as a gift to my sister so i can easily videochat with my family my niece and nephew tend to fight over the echo show when they want to sing along to their favorite songs with the lyrics on the screen my only wish was that there was an hdmi out to connect it to a larger monitor huge missed opportunity in my opinion,20
the kindle fire is small but does everything it should for a young child worth the low cost i paid for it,20
this is a very neat item love all the things this can do,20
my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her kindle,20
the new kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea,20
works well and the speakers decent sounds much better than the nd generation of the echo,20
this works well as it was a gift and connected without issue along with the other two,20
gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games he loved it it s simple to use and inexpensive,20
does exactly what it is needed for my daughter and comes at a great price,20
i have bought the cheaper tablets for my kids in the past however the sales associate recommend this tablet and it was only dollars more so far i am really impressed by the difference in quality,20
this makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition but i m not sure i d want it as an adult there are much better tablets on the market but since it s cheap that s to be expected,20
this is the first echo that we have used and really like it it is easy to set up according to my husband there are things that we would like to do but don t have instructions on how to do them,20
it is safe love the thick case its fun fir my kids,20
i love this this memory card the price was good ty,20
alexa walks you through every step which i found helpful,20
i had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things the extra ram makes a difference very happy and if you re a prime member there are lots of freebies,20
it worked really well for me as i am unschooled in ipads i used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things i needed i e maps books downloaded internet access youtube etc i don t play games so cannot comment on that,20
i have only used this a few times so far but i like it the lightweight and pretty easy to navigate perfect screen size too i ended up purchasing a second one for my fianc,20
purchased for my son who loves to read books saw him watching old tv show he sat down with me and showed me what all it could do who would figure i thought it was just for reading books now i want one too,20
works very well easy to carry around connect to wifi,20
my wife s old kindle stopped holding a charge so to surprise her i stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle this kindle is great its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life my wife uses it every day this is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget,20
i bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters great item and just as nice as the more expensive one she absolutely loves it,20
it s nice to be able to listen to music in the morning and setting reminders is extremely helpful and i love being able to operate my light bulb remotely,20
the kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading,20
i love the capability to see it on the screen and it allows me to not have to use my hands,20
i have all the echo products in this by far is the best it does everything i love it,20
it was by far the best deal out there for the money very happy,20
pleased with alexa have not used light yet i ll update after use,20
i ve love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area that is what i got and more i very satisfied except it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and i am back to satisfaction,20
i use the echo show to stream music video chat and drop in as a camera from my home you can even see recipes and other items worth the money got it on sale i always wait for sales,20
it s not a regular tablet but i just use it to use facebook,20
exactly what i was looking for size wise and functional,20
i am extremely happy with my purchase the kindle is very fast and the screen is clear,20
this is my eighth kindle some others were either lost or screen damaged i bought it as a spare current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen great price also wish i d bought two,20
i bought this as a gift for my grandkids they absolutely love it,20
just got this in the mail last night setting it up today and i want to love it the kicker for me buying it was being able to connect our arlo cameras and view instantly the display in the store had great sound,20
i ve had my fire hd for about a year and have been very satisfied with it my wife has been using an older fire non hd and i thought it was time for an upgrade for her so i decided to buy her this new fire hd for christmas i also installed a sceen protector a new case and a gb sd card before wrapping it she was very surprised and pleased and she noticed the big difference in speed sound and picture quality immediately i m very happy she likes it so much thanks amazon for the great product and best buy for the great price,20
love the color just the right size easy to set up works well for what i needed it for great price,20
i have the echo and a dot this is great for video calling and intercom calling in the house use it every day i run all my photo s stored on amazon prime and for music,20
i bought this for my year old nephew for christmas he loves it and it has a great warranty,20
fantastic tablet fire one is great small and portable,20
i was pleasantly surprised to see the kindle for sale in the store i love my kindle especially since i was able to expand the memory i love that it s portable to be honest when given the choice i find my self on my kindle over my laptop the only thing i can complain about is why in the world amazon choose s to make it nearly a miracle to find a case for its most popular model if you don t have a kindle you don t know what your missing,20
gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it i want to buy one for myself,20
my stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far easy to update and add games apps and school related material go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones,20
i purchased this for my and year old grandchildren they were using parents phones and running the battery down now they have their own device and can watch their cartoons and play games love the case it makes it easy for little hands to hold on to overall very good purchase,20
it is a solid product great for kids i like it a lot,20
it s nice to see my calendar and the sound is good too,20
brought it for my son does exactly what i want it to do,20
highly impressed with my purchase allows me to use my ipad again since my years old granddaughter finally has her own tablet great support and numerous educational apps for children,20
super easy to setup for the kids to use parental controls are a bonus,20
got it for my dad easy to use and he loves it good stepping stone for future producs,20
great value just the right size and weight suits my needs perfectly performs very well easy to get accessories to fit,20
i use it mainly for reading e books and browsing however i wished there were more apps available also before unlocking the tablet ads are shown in the lockscreen if the tab is locked it stops streaming the ads you can pay to disable the ads permanently i only recommend this for basic use if you want to use it for games or other apps i would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy,20
i bought this after i bought the amazon echo this was actually an impulse buy i saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it because i enjoyed the echo so much it does everything the echo does but the sound quality is not great when you re playing at middle volume it s ok the lows are there but doesn t sound good i m guessing i m comparing it with the bose mini soundlink when you set the volume high the bass is almost non existent the mids and highs are loud with the louder volume another difference is that with tap you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands i do like the fact that it s portable because of that i m on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass,20
i love my amazon fire hd it s not too small and not too big i was looking at other tablets and decided on the amazon fire hd because of the price and because i have amazon prime i purchased it online at best buy and then picked it up at the store on black friday it is my first tablet and so i wanted to start with one that i can have fun with and i am i do have a laptop for important things,20
i like the visual with this echo although i think i would have enjoyed it more if this was my first and only alexa,20
i bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop i thought this looked more user friendly since she knows my year old nephew can use an ipad,20
i wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there,20
upgraded from echo to this and this is just what i needed works well with my new ring door bell and security cameras love the versatility of this,20
awseome tablet for kids i would recommend this tablet for all age groups,20
the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs it works well as promised,20
good price works well best buy sales associate was very helpful in selecting this product,20
a great value for the money you can save instead of a ipad from apple,20
works well worth the price good quality product have not had a problem,20
great product very much recommended service at best buy is always the best,20
great tablet for children comes pre loaded with lots of applications for loads of entertainment for younger children it also comes with a year warranty at time of purchase,20
our entire family loves alexa and the white color looks great on our kitchen counters,20
the kindle is great for just reading books and the battery power is pretty good the experimental browser is not very user friendly,20
i m loving this new fire mainly because i didn t fork out a couple hundred for it my only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an ipad so don t look great on this,20
great price great product would recommend this gift,20
good tablet but no youtube kids like on iphone don t expect iphone pad quality very basic appstore for children,20
love how user friendly the kindle fire is for any age,20
it was amazing everything was perfect and it came on time,20
just what i was looking for to putin my guest room it has a good picture,20
i bought two of these fire tablets for gifts for my sons they are both thrilled with the features they use them for gaming music photo albums emails and online activities the hd is what sold me i have a kindle fire nd generation and i enjoyed mine so much since i looked into getting this one,20
the color is what got me and the features was on point the screen shows a lot of different displays to share for now until the next one,20
the tablet is pretty good i would give it stars if you are able to download an use apps from the google store that is one of my only big complaint and also how fast the sd card got filled with items from amazon os that s on the tablet without the user knowing on the other hand with four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful,20
my first ebook reader read some reviews decided to go with this because of the backlight and adaptive light sometimes i have to adjust the light manually but no biggie quick and easy on the eyes,20
great speaker and the sound is great use it every day love being able to use alexa when attached to my network,20
i bought the white version and have it in the kitchen i use it for everything music video phone security cams news weather it s the perfect kitchen assistant,20
i would recommend this to anyone who like to speak commands to technology and have it respond i purchased this for my husband who is sick and he can ask for weather music sport events and more great item,20
a great new amazon device to add to my other alexa products the visuals are amazing and it is so easy to use and set up,20
setting up the amazon show was a little tricky but i managed to navigate through it it s so cool to add compatible equipment,20
tablet is great for kids and adult use i purchased the tablet to use at school with students with disabilities the tablet holds up well holds a charge throughout the week the tablet offers games that do not require wi fi or data if you have a prime membership there are a lot of benefits when using the fire for example free apps free streaming movies music etc,20
great item would definitely recommend this item am still learning all the things about it,20
already have the echo and dot has good sound quality and with the hub feature you can control the hue lights with alexa which is convenient when walking in the house with a bunch of groceries,20
works good have to be very careful with kids overall good product,20
these were ordered one for year old and then ordered second one for year old they are easy to use and age appropriate apps for each of them,20
amazon echo products are terrific and and quite helpful imagine taking the alexa voice and adding some video to it really cool great for the kitchen where you can use it for recipes as well as music and other things,20
i bought two of these for two of my children the parental controls are great and i can easily control their access to content the ability to make them do something educational like read for min before playing games is awesome this tablet does everything i wanted it to do,20
i like this ereader it is a little small but you can increase the font,20
it was great product the price which i got it was great,20
we have two echo ourselves and purchased this as a gift for someone we have smart plugs for our lamps that alexa turns on off,20
it does everything amazon and i can even see who is at the front door with arlo it doesn t do netflix or hulu but that s okay i really like the sound it fills small rooms it s easy now to video chat with nana or drop in to tell my kid s goodnight when i am working late,20
i had my doubts when i first purchased it but after just a day i had synced it with my thermostat lights tv bose sound system and many more amazing product couldn t be happier,20
bought for my grandson he loves playing with it and enjoys the videos,20
the new tablet is great nice upgrades love how easy it is to use easy to get apps shop and browse the web,20
this device meets the needs of my grandson he can read and play games on it it also has the parental safeguards,20
fun to use for any age just say alexa,20
added screen a great features visual effect a plus,20
kids love it great christmas present even if not an apple product,20
perfect size for me speaker clarity is amazing and produces a great picture,20
best kindle charger ever took minutes to being my kindle back to life,20
i loved the amazon echo but to be able to see so much more on the screen is amazing i highly recommend,20
i love the alexa system of assistance this version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won t get to have to the option to pick up you need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private i installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use,20
i ve had kindles for years and this latest one is also right up at the top,20
bought for my year old and she loves it haven t had any issues,20
great product loving alexa was so happy with it that know its a big part of all that i do,20
i would highly recommend the kindle fire for a first time user it was really very easy to learn to navigate,20
i have both the kindle voyage and the low end kindle fire while the fire is an amazing deal for serious readin g the kindle voyage is far easier on the eyes and has superior resolution now it lacks many of the features of the less expensive fire such as color and online with wifi as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure truthfully it isn t a whole lot better than the paperwhite it has a feature or two but i m not sure it s worth the extra dollars it is still an excellent device,20
i recently had purchased enough smart home devices to make this a good addition for the home it works well with smart outlets our ring doorbell and fairly well with our nest thermostat my only complaint is that sometimes for no reason it will start plying a movie trailer and it s hard to get it to stop still all in all we re happy with the purchase,20
purchased for my grandson he loves it when setting up be sure to update the software,20
got it as a christmas gift and i love it i would recommend this product,20
this is a great tablet for the price i bought it to replace my ipad mini great for ereading and general browsing,20
great tablet not for the power user average users will find everything they need,20
fantastic product and does exactly as described great gift idea,20
with this you can make calls to other echo shows or using the app you can call others that have the a show i haven t used this feature yet since i m the only one i know who has one i can tell you that while using the app at home or away from home off the network you can call the show i did this while at work to check it out and caught my son coming in the back door i freaked him out but after he settled down we chatted via video chat for awhile and both agreed it was awesome you could also just drop into the show from the app to check on the house or whatever wherever you have it keep in mind you re only gonna see what it s pointed at the camera doesn t move plus in its natural form it is tilted back slightly so it point upward there are stands on amazon the correct the tilt to make it straight up and down almost forgot but the speakers are amazing you can link multiple echos together to play music i have the show in my living room an echo in my bedroom and the dot connected to a jbl speaker in another room after set up through the app i can tell alexa to play music and they all come to life,20
i tryed the gb to see if it was any different from the gb and found little difference may hold more apps,20
got this tablet for my yr old daughter and it has been great for her it s the right size for her little hands only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it apps have to be from amazon and they might not have the app you want,20
this is my second one and must have one of these at all times,20
my year old son really enjoys the tablet it s great,20
i enjoy my kindle immensely so much better than having to start up my computer,20
this does the same stuff as the traditional echo or echo dot except it has a screen if you already liked the echo s this is a good addition the addition of the screen is neat but certainly not essential you can see daily news headlines and the weather scroll across the screen you can watch any arlo or similar cameras on it you can watch youtube and amazon video as well but you ll probably just watch that on a phone tablet or tv instead,20
the best part about the echo is that you can actually use it to watch videos the security cameras connected to your house listen to music and watch the baby sleep i love my echo show,20
has everything you will ever need inside for children and adultsa,20
set up was simple we liked so much we bought one for my mom,20
too difficult to setup not compatible with other equipment,20
very helpful for someone with disabilities saves a lot steps responsive and fun to use,20
this has been an exceptional hit for us she totally loves it,20
the echo show feels useless after a few hours especially without the ability to watch youtube,20
fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything,20
we replaced and aging fire hdx she noticed the wifi connection is improved and the screen is larger she prefers this to my ipad air,20
the display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good probably better for reading than watching videos we didn t really get it for the games but there is a good selection wifi works well and internet browsing is fast,20
this is a first for an adult price is right easy to use and just the right size,20
great tablet new to me so i have a lot to learn about it s functions,20
got this for my year old daughter she enjoys playing games and reading books a faster processor would me it better,20
very nice people and good product i would buy from again,20
bought as a gift for christmas they love it,20
my son just loves it and he thinks it s easy to use and the case that comes on it has saved it,20
i am an old traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books now i don t lose what page i was on and have more shelf space where books used to be,20
bought it on sale for christmas gift and we ll worth the money does everything needed with good functionality easy to use for those not too tech savvy,20
this is my second kindle have a few more items to learn but love it easy to get around the apps,20
it has great speakers and is very easy to set up love my echo,20
had the echo plus over a week and this thing is amazing great sound and easy to move around a little tricky with the set up but works great,20
the kindle fire hd has a larger screen vs and images are crisper with more vibrant colors,20
i don t recommend buying this after month of buying this it won t charge or turn on,20
i have an echo that i bought from best buy several months ago so when it came to buying one for my son his family for christmas i knew where to come it s an excellent information hub,20
alexa works great but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up,20
i was hesitant and i am now hooked this is both fun and useful,20
i love it it does so much and is so easy to use i use it mostly for music and questions,20
really enjoy this product love watching movies and playing games on my fire hd,20
great product and service will refer to a friend and the sales man r good,20
alexa has changed my life i now own alexas o,20
bought for my husband for christmas we keep it in our kitchen and mainly just use it for music but our kids love that they can tell alexa to play a song they like and it plays,20
i was given a fire when i was recuperating from spine surgery a few years ago i used it for everything for quite some time this one has a camera and plays all the latest files i still have and use the old one as well an excellent content delivery system i got it with best buy customer appreciation money what a deal,20
got this to replace the samsung tab a that samsung tab lagged a lot but i haven t seemed to have as much problems on the fire tab the only downside is that the battery dies fast,20
this was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books couple this with amazon gift cards and the library is endless,20
i wish i could just say it is one of my best investment i love the fact that now i don t have to drag around several of my favorite books i can now have them all in one convenient place the battery life is great my little girl loves that she can play games on it i think it s great i should have gotten more memory though,20
very handy to get the morning news as well as asking him to play music,20
purchased one for my older son last year got this second d one for the younger one so they don t fight over them,20
overall it is a good tablet but i am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and amazon app store,20
gift for my great nephew and he really loves it he loves it so much that mom has to limit amount of time he allowed to play with it because he would play it,20
i had an alexa but thought the show would be cool as it would allow me to link a camera to it see videos for info i wanted to look up play my prime video account it would have been a if i could see all prime shows movies on it,20
killer tablet for the price no issues running any apps or programs,20
my wife loves to read but she was always hesitant to try ebooks she used to think that ebooks could never have the same tactile feel as a physical book i talked her into it by telling her its lighter easier to hold can hold thousands of books and if she hated it we can return it but she loves ebooks now and doesnt want to go back she also found out that amazon has a lot of books which cost nothing namely classics and such i think if you like to read in the dark then get the paperwhite version the led s are a nice touch,20
once taking time to install google play store it functioned as good as any other android tablet the down side is camera which doesn t produce clear pictures,20
great notepad huge screen and easily downloaded apps to use love it,20
i bought this for my wife this is her third amazon fire tablet she mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one she s very happy with it,20
excellent product turns on and off supported devices by asking it live walking into a room and asking alexa to turn on a light poof it s done or locking and unlocking the front door arming and disarming my security system if you re looking to turn your house into a smarthome i strongly recommend the amazon echo plus,20
i love it the sound is great i use it everyday for my dogs to listen to when i am at work,20
i bought both of my children one of these tablets they love it,20
i bought this as a gift for my son and i know he will love it he has the old kindle fire as likes it a lot,20
this product is amazing i wasn t quite sure why everyone was going on and on about having one but now that it s in my house i cannot imagine life without it alexa not only answers my questions and gives me valuable information but now she controls the lights of my house for me i highly recommend this,20
always a good price and good for what it s meant for,20
as always great job very easy to use and it s always with me only problem i have is the button on the bottom is touchy but not really an issue keep up the good work,20
the tablet works great so far the parent features are nice also,20
this was a great purchase with one hue bulb included with the echo plus installation set up was a breeze,20
my son wanted a tablet just for his books we looked at e readers and tablets this was so much better and the price was perfect,20
this is just what we needed for a you k d the apps are great,20
i love my echo show i wish you could watch movies or tc shows or you tube so hopefully they will add that soon,20
i got to say that love it makes it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my needs,20
i should have purchased a kindle sooner it s easy to use and i love it,20
bought this mostly as a backup and to read a few books since i have a larger cell phone and a back up used it occasionally may or hours of use till this week when i sent my laptop in for repairs so i probably used it a tot this week i was watching my rd primetime video this week and it simply turned off it will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode it is gone it is toast bought it october it quit on february my old fire lasted or years with more use it had stereo speakers lasted a week on a charge not or days sturdier built this is full of junk i am not just offered more apps it is constantly trying to add them junk junk junk,20
i love my original kindle fire but the size and features on the latest kindle are a plus,20
i love the functionality of this amazon tablet bought one for me and one for the hubby,20
looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened,20
i bought of these for gifts i love my echo and think the new one will be incredible too after the holidays i will buy one for myself,20
nicer than my old fire better screen area to view,20
i was reluctant to purchase the echo plus and my best friend said to do it you will love it i did and she was so right the philips hue light bulb was an added bonus and love that too,20
used it and looks very paper like they integrated the simplest form of an e reader which makes it stand out for its use,20
love this product i can ask questions and play music also link my lights to it,20
i purchased these tablets for my grandchildren after purchasing for another grandchild in october they love them and their parents love being able to dictate how they use them,20
not a huge fan of products that aren t apple but this one is good haven t had any problems with them at all,20
i just love every thing about it its awesome to read,20
fun product that can be used for many purposes great for streaming or reading on the go with great graphics makes an awesome gift,20
so i bought my little guys these tablets so that i could repossess my ipad love the free time app but who could ve imagined they wouldn t play netflix so now i m out the money for the tablet and still don t have my ipad back and yes i called amazon numerous times they work after the fix but the next time they go to use them they don t work again the fix takes several minutes as it s force stopping the app clearing cache then doing a hard restart then you have to wait to restart netflix oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works if it works at all,20
great for first time tablet but more advanced options available,20
good age appropriate learning tool for kids there is a variety of apps kids can download to keep them from getting bored overall a good tablet for the kids,20
i like my show but i can t say i love it for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices it has probably the worst microphone getting it to respond is frustrating at times where i have no problem with a standard echo besides this it all works as advertised i d wait for the second generation i m sure they can work the kinks out,20
great product and great service from bestbuy online,20
love that i can control my lights with the phillips bulbs and is compatible with smart plugs to control other electronics in the house definitely would recommend,20
bought the echo first and liked it so much i bought a tap to add mobility i carry it around all the time to the garage working out etc,20
my niece and nephew are going to love this i got it for a great price too what a nice christmas present,20
i like it i use it everyday and so far no cons im very please,20
got this on sale for replaces my cds must buy as long as you have prime,20
plays all my ipod music via bluetooth also plays radio stations you can t get on a regular radio very practical and fun,20
for the money you will be well pleased i think it is a big bargain,20
i bought two of these for my granddaughters and they are very easy to use and they love them,20
great product and i m very satisfied with it i recommend it to other people,20
great tablet for my and year old kid friendly safe and mom and dad enjoy it as well love that it comes in a protective case reasonably priced for a great tablet the kids love,20
love the echo show allows me to control lights alarm vacuum and lots of stuff no brainer to set up make lists keep up with calendar plays music tells jokes and sings badly but is fun couldn t be happier with it,20
with this echo line we are able to watch amazon prime and even do visual calls to grand daughter,20
i have always been a nook customer but recently their models have not received good feedback so while shopping for a new ereader i had to make the decision between the two the biggest influence behind price while the new samsung model of the nook definitely looks great it also has a big price tag overall we are very happy with this purchase it is mostly used as an ereader but we have downloaded a few games kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader,20
we use it to talk to our granddaughter play games listen to music and check on the dog while we are at work awesome device we already bought one for our kids also,20
ok so when i got this tablet i was not expecting to much from it but now that i have used it its amazing pros their is no lag at all when play high graphic games pretty easy to use very fast speedcons in my opinion their is only things that drive me insane the screen feels like plastic very uncomfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photos overall get this tablet better deal then the galaxy tab s,20
liked the first one so much i bought one for the wife,20
fits nicely in your hand and its touchable increase the size of the fonts,20
was recommended to purchase by a family member who has one who is very happy with it,20
bought this for my daughter to use in school she loves it product works great i also bought the older version for my mom and she lives it as well,20
is good for the kids the only thing is i have to get a sd card for more memory,20
i really like this device right now i only have light sync d with it but looking forward to adding more another feature i like is the ability to put items on both my shopping and errand lists i can t wait to find out all the things it can do for me,20
i bought the kindle fire hd as a christmas gift for my mom she has never had a computer or kindle she loves it best gift i gave her she plays a lot of games on it that keeps her mind working love the size of screen,20
lightweight and convenient to use love my new kindle,20

this tablet works well for surfing the internet and playing music,20
bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it it s so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls,20
the only thing i have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device why is that,20
this is great my daughters first tablet and it came with everything she needed to get started she loves the pink bumper guard and so do i for the safety,20
my son loves his new tablet now he can play his games without making a mess of my phone,20
it great just a little small then what i would like it have been,20
i bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire so far it has exceeded my expectations all my apps have transferred flawlessly the battery lasts me hours with moderate internet use glad i made this purchase,20
has built in smart hub unlike other echos works with other smart home devices with no additional purchases,20
replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon with electronics in the cabin under scrutiny this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill perfect in small purses and large pockets i can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you re holding it,20
this was a christmas present for the nephew works good he loves it,20

for me this tablet is an extremely good value ipads are beautiful things and they seem to just work really well all the time but they are expensive same thing with android tablets you can get a cheap android tablet but then you re left with a cheap tablet poor quality displays questionable hardware limited support i think amazon hit the spot with their line of fire tablets this hd in particular it s good quality has a great display it s quick and snappy has great battery life also being an android based operating system there is flexibility like accessing storage side loading third party apps even installing google play for those who begrudge the lack of that feature it can be done much more flexibility than you get with an apple product at a much lower price than the industry standard samsung etc coming from using apple products for so long this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than apple and especially for the price its a great introduction to a different platform not only that it s genuinely a good product,20
took some time to get use to the kindle reader use to the ipad but i like that i can read without distractions,20
very nice easy to use got it to use with amazon prime great combo,20
purchased as a gift for the family can t wait to use it,20
kindle products are fantastic i ve used a kindle now have a kindle fire use it everyday so naturally i would select a kindle for my granddaughter,20
great choice battery life outstanding many kid friendly features,20
bought it for my wife and i haven t heard any complaints so i think it s great if she s happy i m happy,20
easy to use wide variety of functions awesome price,20
i like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k,20
set up for kids right out of the box can t beat amazon s warranty either thanks for providing an outstanding product,20
i purchased two of these tablets as a gift for christmas it has an exceptional hd screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book articles etc,20
runs great very efficient for what we use it for,20
alexa is now a family member how have i lived my life without her i have no idea,20
it s a nice upgrade from the screen size is just right for small kids hands reading kindle books is much easier,20
got this tablet for my yr old daughter and it has been great for her it s the right size for her little hands only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it apps have to be from amazon and they might not have the app you want,20
difficult to purchase no stock in stores no order online or ship to store available when it did become available it did not work once it turned on i couldn t get any further i could not log onto wifi network though other items in my household work also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock tried days gave up and returned the item,20
fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well good tablet for books and games for all the family,20
this has kept my kids entertained but maybe just a little too entertained sadly they don t want to do much else,20
if you like to control smart gadgets this is definitely for you,20
they make it seem like you can pretty much ask anything to alexa but she never knows anything it is very non responsive at times too,20
it was all that my grandson wanted and didn t have to search everywhere to find it,20
this was the perfect gift for grandkids i bought one in pink and one in green so each grandchild would have their own color lots of games come with the tablet and additional games and videos can be added,20
this little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming my kids have quickly learned that alexa is their personal dj when hooked up to the amazon prime unlimited music program battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass but it does the job for our family,20
my grandson takes it on trips and he loves it it s easy to use,20
i was jealous when our son showed us his amazon show and some of the things it was capable of doing since aol eliminated instant messaging my wife and i were less able to communicate because our offices are on separate floors so we got two shows and two spots and now not only can intercom easily but use alexa for music and many other things we will probably start using some smart home devices which alexa can also control it s a fun device which seems to be getting better all the time,20
i have an old kindle touch the last one that still had text to voice which no longer works i decided to upgrade started reading the reviews was enticed by the the kindle voyage and took the plunge the voyage is pretty and sleek with neat features and i enjoyed using it for a few days but my frugal self just couldn t justify the price difference between it and the paperwhite while the ambient light sensor was nice i often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room i made more errors of turning a page than i meant to with the page turn because of where the page turn spots are located plus i m in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet so i kept swiping despite the availability of page turn however the clarity of the screen the quality of the light the form factor the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice nonetheless the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the paperwhite the thing i miss most about the voyage is the quality of the light and how even the lighting is on it the unit i had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the voyage i purchased the newest model of the paperwhite and i like it but the lighting appears pretty dingy however it s only when they re compared side to side that i wished i wasn t so cost conscious if money is not an object i d say get the kindle voyage if it is the paperwhite is a fine little reader and overall i m happy i have it,20
i personally love this because i can bring it every where i go and sing and its fun,20
works great for everything we want our daughter to do,20
awesome product my wife and i love it makes home automation simple,20
i bought this for controlling most of my smart device,20
i purchased this kindle for my wife because her kindle fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the fire since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus the main drawback is that the graphics aren t as clear with this reader all in all it was money well spent,20
i love being able to use alexa she is an amazing ai until the robots rebel against the human kind i think it s worth it,20
i ve wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when bb put it on sale i am not disappointed,20
works great can t wait to find all it can do for me,20
it did exactly what it s suppose to and i m still learning new features a month after having it very good decice,20
love the sound i am able to plug in a lamp in a hard to reach spot since it is now voice activated,20
gift was on point recipient was very pleased would recommend to others,20
this is a great product i also have a dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus the hands free mode works just like the dot and the sound is great i use the tap all the time working on projects making shopping lists playing games to turning on the lights i looked at the echo but even with a battery pack it didn t seem very mobile,20
have been pleased with my purchase of the fire hd as it s video quality is great when viewing espn netflix youtube tutorials the ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the amazon kindle app is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an ipad,20
this is a must have is great for recepies while you are cooking alexa gives you the info for the ines that are used to a tablet or ipod that you have to stop and read this is awesome plus so much easier to follow things,20
very kid friendly especially for toddlers and easy to use,20
wanted to expand alexa into multiple rooms of the house this device added easily into the system and can now listen to music in multiple rooms,20
i like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports etc still not using it to its full potential but we have it controlling a couple of lamps giving us weather reports setting timers and alarms it s making me lazy sometimes it doesn t hear my voice hears my husband s voice better i find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table,20
child loves it can be used for more than just a time killer can learn from it,20
it is so fun to talk to alexa the sound is also very high quality i am very happy with my purchase,20
we have bought two taps one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son we love the portability of the tap it s perfect for our deck our grandchildren love it too,20
i use this thing every night to fall asleep although alexa don t always understand me i still love the device,20
i thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm i think it is too small to read on it not very comfortable as regular kindle would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead,20
got it for my grandson he loves it it is a very good tablet,20
the only thing i would say is that you have to do a work around for direct tv other that that it is great,20
we have been using our kindle fire for years and it wore out we looked at replacing it with another fire until i saw the fire the display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference,20
purchased for my husband but this is more a gift for the entire family luv the display,20
this device is alot better than the small alexa did everything i wanted it to,20
i m not huge on kids using electronics but my son loves this when we take trips as he can play some of the downloaded games we love it for when we want to get stuff done and still want him to be occupied and this does the trick it s a little hard to navigate at first though,20
my sister in law recommended these to my wife and i and i thought i would try one they are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while,20
fits easily into my purse or bag small compact,20
our whole family loves and uses this device for so many different features we love using it to make phone calls watch films play jeopardy even to define words as they come up in conversation we definitely get a lot of use out of this device more than any other screen tablet or smart phone device we own,20
upgraded my year old kindle same old doesnt seem that great of a difference the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading,20
so i was skeptical of echo show and the entire line to be honest however this technology has changed how our household operates from my daily briefing in the morning to tracking santa with my year old every morning learning interesting facts about santa and several other things i truly wish i would have bought this sooner we have it integrated into our cozi account so we can just ask alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in we also have adt pulse and a nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple i couldn t believe it my son loves to ask alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is i am loving the amazon music now as well because we bought an echo dot just to integrate into our bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now if you are on the fence about getting the echo show like i was just do it it really is an amazing product,20
this is a great tablet because of all the preloaded games and ability to add more for free it keeps my kids entertained and is the best for learning,20
bought this for my better half and she loves it it works very well with echo and has unlimited features,20
amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up,20
he loved it was a great gift easy to use small and great,20
great sound love the music and the electrical devices you can work with it,20
for those that have prime this is almost a must have keeps all your amazon stuff in one place,20
when it works it s great but for some reason it doesn t always answer me when it doesn t answer me i turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn t work at that time it was easy to set up with the phone app doesn t seem to matter where the phone is when it isn t working i ve tried close and far and in between so a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn t,20
she knows all the answers i m used to speaking to her i recently visiting a friend and said alexa and my friend looked at me like i was crazy she doesn t have alexa,20
i gave this amazon fire hd as a retirement gift for my friend and she absolutely loves it,20
your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps videos and the internet you can not get a better deal the yr anything happens warranty is a big plus it s not the fastest thing on the market it s desent picture quality is great everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy love the fact that i can program it to have her read mins st before she can fully access it also that i can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week,20
my wife loves this tablet much easier to use than previous tablets that we purchased,20
alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated,20
great product that a whole family would enjoy it s a perfect addition to the household,20
i enjoyed and i bought an echo too to make all my family take the pleasure of it,20
i have had a kindle for some time and was curious about the oasis it did not disappoint it is very compact even with the cover and fits in a coat pocket i really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons great device for home or on the go,20
great item for the new home better than purchasi this is a good product,20
best xmas gift and great product made by amazon now my fam is all connected,20
my granddaughter loved her tablet and the color it s amazing how easy it is for her to use perfect birthday gift,20
it was too slow he didn t put any attention to it battery didn t last,20
i loved this tablet i did but i did not love that i was being sold ads every time i powered up i loathe even more that i would have had to pay to discontinue that feature amazon if you want dollars for the kindle fire charge it but don t under price the device and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity it is unbecoming of you i returned this item pronto,20
haven t been able to train alexa like we ve heard probably our own fault we have fun with it,20
great alternative to using tablet for reading only problem is trying to read a pdf file it only enlarges the page and does not resize the document to easily move forward,20
my mom bought the tablets first for my sisters for christmas an then my year old wanted one so i purchased one for her she loves it uses it for games netflix an she is home school so she is able to do her work on the tablet as well,20
the amazon tap is a perfect complement to our amazon echo put this in our office space has all the advantages of the echo and is also a great bluetooth speaker having to tap the mic button to summon alexa is no issue at all sound quality is as good as any bluetooth speaker on the market and it s extremely portable,20
the show is a great little product it has opened a lot of doors in the world of ai and home automation for me it connected easily with my echo and dot and now i can stream music all over my house the picture quality is outstanding the only drawback is that alexa doesn t have a very strong internet search engine,20
great screen resolution and easy to use battery life is really good,20
love my new kindle i hadn t read in a while and hesitant of a kindle easy to use lightweight and convenient to pick up a book great for outdoor reading only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light crisp clear text and easy to set up,20
improved over the hd things set up differently but not hard to learn also a bit heavier than the so reading in bed a little harder,20
this tablet is perfect for my six year old s learning apps,20
easy to use for a year old she loves it i just don t like that my amazon account is linked to her tablet,20
the built in hue allows the echo plus to automatically search and finds connectable devices the larger speaker area assists in better sound and the alexa to hear my voice,20
this is a great product at a great price i would definitely recommend this to anybody especially good for college students or people that read books etc,20
i got this for my daughter she enjoy playing this,20
very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don t work very well charging port very low quality,20
i have an lg tablet but picked up this one for my dad and after messing with it for a while it s very nice i think i like it more the my lg g pad,20
got it to gift to my friend absolutely loved it good value,20
kid prof and comes with free books and games i like it,20
this is a great tablet for the price amazon is doing a good job,20
a little more complicated than my original kindle but i like it,20
this is actually for a gift second one i purchased but great priduct,20
great tablet and price ordering online easy not happy took so long to receive though,20
this tablet is great for trips just make sure you download games and shows on it first since it does not have internet the case is great for kids who are rough with technology it really takes a beating,20
we love this so much in our home we bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it they love watching their movies on it and playing different apps it is a really good value,20
powerful and quality sound love the portability just don t understand why this one can t read my notifications while the dot can,20
size brightness and convenience are good the option to link with android products for messages is a little hard,20
i bought this as a backup i am currently using the same headphone,20
bought for our son so he wouldn t have to carry books back from his deployment,20
i think the price is great the durability the easiness although you do need to spend money as well for extra better games and the charger breaks easily but u can use any android charger overall well worth the price i believe,20
we gave this tablet to our nine year old grandaughter for her birthday she loves it and we feel it is very sturdy that is a very good thing when it comes to tablets and children,20
this ia a great product more technology to make your life easier,20
this is my eighth kindle some others were either lost or screen damaged i bought it as a spare current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen great price also wish i d bought two,20
despite not being able to get one of these from amazon until late june due to apparent strong demand best buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release april well done best buy having owned several previous kindles including the most recent paperwhite model i was unprepared for how small and light this new oasis model is reading about it is one thing but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely the oasis and its battery charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest paperwhite with no case the oasis without its cover feels impossibly light at ounces size wise the oasis is nearly a square shape at about wide by tall in fact the shape is so different from traditional kindle designs that i had to compare it next to my paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size they are it s the first kindle i think i could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort for frequent travelers like me this is a key reason to buy one of these as it s extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse the screen is the first front lit kindle i ve ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the leds from any angle no dark spots no bright spots just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions the page also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface helping achieve the illusion of printed paper it s sharp and clear better than any kindle i ve used the reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart since they are held together with magnets after doing so this is where the amazon engineering team s achievements really become clear as you just won t believe how lightweight this thing is it s easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it degrees when switching the display instantly rotates and the page turn buttons also follow with the top button always used to advance the page and the bottom button always used to go backward you can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models the battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover s battery so it runs down faster if you don t have it connected to the case it s very easy to snap the reader back into its cover which allows it to recharge while you continue to read the power button and charge port are located in the upper top right corner more or less opposite from where they are on the paperwhite i find this location to be less awkward as it s easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge the back surface of the reader not the case seems to easily attract fingerprints and they are not so easy to clean off you d think that amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now it s a minor annoyance lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model s high price relative to other kindle models without ads it s vs for an ad less paperwhite is this a lot of money perhaps but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that s easy on both your arms and your eyes then i personally think it s worth it a lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit and the price reflects that is it for everyone probably not but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you ll have to wait to get one on amazon s website if you are a serious reader this device deserves a very close look i m definitely keeping mine,20
got one for my mom in order to video chat with her works awesome,20
easy to use and great selection of books movies and games,20
a great new amazon device to add to my other alexa products the visuals are amazing and it is so easy to use and set up,20
bought this for my year old grandson who s a bit rough but loves to play games and read he loves it,20
easy to use quick setup fantastic screen and the colors are vibrant,20
works as described love the kid friendly foam protector it stopped working within months of purchase amazon just sent new one without a real fuss inconvenient but no real fuss i hope this one lasts longer,20
great for my son i monitor school work and apps he downloads,20
i love this tablet i got one for each one of the kids all different ages and they all love it,20
alexa makes my life easy by turning my lights on and off playing my favorite music and so much more it really can control anything,20
my kid love this tablet the setup was so easy and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps that my kid can enjoy playing and learning,20
it can stream music really well and not just from amazon i was expecting it to be smart like watson but it is more like an blank stare amazon should look into predicting questions like during superbowl play offs alexa was unable to display or update the play off brackets it understands my voice really well were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what i am saying it want pair to my portable bluetooth speaker it will pair to my cell phone but only to receive music from it the audio quality is varies with amplitude with low amplitudes alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room but an amplitude setting of about the audio becomes clear and understandable i really like playing games like jeopardy with alexa no climbing through the closet to find a box anymore and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing,20
was good price wish it had google play download on to it,20
we love the parent controls and durability we would definitely buy another,20
this was one of the best birthday presents i ever purchased for my husband he said he doesn t use the computer but he was on my smartphone daily viewing fb i got him a drone for christmas and he needed something to view while it is flying i researched the kindle fire and thought he could practice with it until spring he farms so isn t busy in the winter thank goodness because he is busy with his kindle for hours every day he thinks it is great and i do too because now i have my phone back,20
i bought this as a gift for my daughter s nd birthday and she totally loved it now she s wanting me to buy a second one so that i can keep it on the first floor she says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other i think it was a great purchase so i think i m going to have to buy another one,20
this kindle fire blows away my other tablet for performance battery life readability color and many other options i love this size as well,20
i bought this for my month old daughter and she has already learned how to use it what a great way to keep her busy and quiet at the same time thanks,20
no complaints i just wish it played avi but that is not really a huge problem,20
we re still learning all the things this device can do so far we re very pleased,20
great product for a very good price loved this tablet,20
love my kendal but cannot find a case or screen saver for it,20
i waited a couple months to review giving amazon time to make this product equal to the sony dash from nearly a decade ago it isn t the screen provides nothing of value and you can t turn of amazon tips you have near zero customization can t even move the clock to the other side of the screen and something that a sony dash did nearly years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm seriously this is the biggest fail run away from this half baked amazon disaster,20
durable worth every penny got it for our year old daughter amazed how easily she can navigate it,20
bought of these for my and yr old and it said it came with gb storage but actual storage was a little less cant remember exactly how much probably around gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre installed they mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them there is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera love the product comes in different color as well i got the blue,20
good tablet gave as gift and person enjoys it recommend,20
great for reading best part is its light weight and long battery life,20
my son is constantly distracted and loves technology him being only two years old this proved to be the perfect thing to keep him occupied and out of trouble,20
perfect start for smart home works perfect with echo,20
i love the internet tweeting and facebook no computers can complete me my kindle takes care of all my needs juju,20
my nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift kindle suits it well for him to learn and study,20
this is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price i bought this when it is on sale for for gb sd card you have a great tablet when plenty of space i used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced this tablet is a deal,20
quite an upgrade from the original fire the deletion of the carousel was a welcome change the new turn style approach is faster and more consice still don t know why a chime sounds also miss the ease of making notes while reading there has got to be a better way to organize books trying to figure out series trilogies etc is impossible and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that amazon won t pick up a new purchase as a book already read,20
purchased for an year old that wanted this badly appears to be rugged links up with my amazon account for content and access year warranty win,20
this is my second kindle have a few more items to learn but love it easy to get around the apps,20
great product for when you are on the go great sound,20
the echo show is a great accessory to any house it has a great picture on it and great sound it s simple to use my wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists also listens to music with crisp sound can ask alexa pretty much anything,20
really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter learning i do wish it had more storage and more items for kids but we do love the tablet,20
i bought this for my grandson and it hasn t disappointed me at all he loves his tablet i am looking at buying his sister one next,20
the show is our new best friend we watch shows on it everyday at lunch time and we end every night saying alexa turn off screen,20
great product absolute love it alexa is fun to converse with and has a wealth of information,20
i purchased this product because i love to read and buying books got costly with this product i can read all i want for a month,20
i really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well,20
this is my second fire wanted a larger size to make ebooks easier to read very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet easy to take along in a tote perfect for what i wanted it for,20
we own an ipad samsug tablets and we have both love are fire s wave better,20
i love everything about this alexa if you re on the fence just buy it it does everything,20
this is my second kindle fire and i have been extremely pleased with them both this second one is much more versatile and i love it,20
easy access to book reader love watching my netflix con slow getting on internet,20
purchased this for my wife during christmas and got a great deal on it compared to the older version that she has this model is faster brighter and more convenient with alexa i would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it,20
this tablet has beautiful color graphics and is super thin easy to carry with you,20
the echo plus is a fantastically easy to use smarthome hub it is easy to setup fast and responsive has a ton of capabilities that are expanding daily and looks and sounds great i currently use mine to manage my smart things like light bulbs lamps smart switches and even my robot vac it has made automating a lot of what i do daily a breeze and has simplified my life where i didn t know it needed to be simplified definitely worth the extra money to go with the plus over the echo or the dot,20
great price on a good tablet especially on black friday,20
bought for my son works great great tablet for the,20
bought for daughter in law and she likes it she wanted a fire,20
this is excellent for toddlers and also as they grow numerous things they can do on it and also nice to be abke to control it as a parent,20
this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s in but this is about cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s was not doing it for me,20
screen is really nice great for videos i would definetly recommend it,20
new kindle fire is easy to setup great for reading no issues at all when trying to connect to my home network i would recommend this item for anyone who wants to read and get on the internet,20
i love this tablet it s the perfect size for my kid keeps him entertained during long trips we picked up the free time kid proof case and it s perfect also,20
amazon echo show is the best of all my amazon products i love the hands free but able to see things on the screen,20
great looking display text is sharp and easy to read the lighting of screen is wonderful for reading in lower light environments this is a little more compact than the paper white model i really love the page press button areas makes it so you can turn pages without adjusting your hand as long as you are holding the voyage with your thumb resting in the button area sounds like a minor thing but to me it s a big convenience,20
this is a very good tablet the only con is you may have to reboot it too often,20
so my month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet however my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my ipad but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys which makes the kindle fire tablet for kids the best invention since the tivo all the pre loaded apps videos books etc is nothing short of amazing the case is also very cool hardwood floor and stair case proof for under bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine,20
i ve had lots of tablets in the past mostly from the samsung line but this is my first amazon fire so i want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these at the time that this was written alexa had not been added to the tablet first while this device runs an android type of operating system amazon puts its own spin on the operating system i don t feel like i m using android this feels different to me it doesn t have the same level of customization that android users have come to appreciate that being said if you are an amazon prime member this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine it s simply a fun way to consume your magazines books etc there are on screen buttons on the bottom of the device the middle button immediately takes you to your home screen the button to the left acts as a sort of back button it also lets me get rid of my keyboard when i don t need it on screen but it s open the button to the right is super important it took me a couple of days to realize what it does that square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open it lets you switch between apps but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out you can close them by pressing the x button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right if you leave all of those apps open and you never close them you ll drain your battery make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps the device has several menus that you swipe left to view first you start with your home screen you literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet all of your apps are housed here you swipe up to view all of them the tablet comes with several apps pre installed such as slik amazon s own internet browser audible good reads the amazon app store a weather app etc you can go to the amazon app store to download other apps such as twitter facebook etc you can combine the apps on this page into folders you just drag one app to another app and a folder appears this made my home screen much more manageable you can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings this feature doesn t necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps however i believe it only changes the font on your main screens if you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device when you have a new issues it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of new items the device comes with a free month subscription to the washington post you ll see that under new items when you initially activate your tablet you can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos you can do this through the settings menu on the device if you want to use one of your own photos however you need to either take it on the device or move it into amazon s photos app which is a cloud based app so far i haven t found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper i m not crazy about the amazon photo app i found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into amazon s cloud just so i could view them on my tablet that being said i m not planning to take photos on this device i just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper beyond the home screen you can swipe to the right to view your other screen they are pre arranged to be books videos games shop apps music audiobooks and newstand all of those screens are connected to your amazon account for example if you have kindle books you ve already purchased they automatically will appear under the books menu your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu there doesn t seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages that bugs me but it s not the end of the world there s also one menu to the left of the home menu it s the recent page it shows you what you ve received looked at on the tablet i never use it but it might be handy for some people one of my favorite features of this tablet is amazon s on deck capability if you re an amazon prime member amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like the items don t count against your pre installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full you can turn off the on deck feature if you don t like it i ve been content with the video playback capability this isn t my major use of the device but the images look fine and the audio is ok i ll talk more about the speakers later my other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the newstand i ve tried magazines on here and they all look gorgeous now i can always have my magazines with me so if i m stuck at the airport or at the doctor s office i always have them one of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free i just had to connect my account to the device this allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as i ve had an account my other magazine didn t include a digital edition so i canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version it was an inexpensive magazine anyway there are several magazines that you can try free for days on the device i did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure the kindle fire doesn t come with the google play store installed you can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty you can google to find the instructions to do this it s not difficult to do if you re fairly comfortable with technology it probably took me minutes most of the apps i wanted were in the amazon store but there were a handful that i had paid for through google play the only way i could have them was to go back to access that store they have worked fine so far i despise the keyboard that amazon pre installed on this device there are no lines between the letters on the keyboard i suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys but i hate it i fixed that problem by going to google play and downloading a new keyboard it was a pretty easy problem to solve so i can t complain apps that are connecting to the internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets but that generally doesn t bother me if you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop however that might drive you crazy the screen on this device isn t bad if i compare it to my fancy phone it s not as shape but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone the screen is outstanding the speakers are ok there are two of them located on the bottom of the screen i won t say that they are fantastic they aren t in my opinion they are fine for watching youtube or a television show they are not ok for listening to music if you are an audiophile you can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre install app but still your music will sound tinny that being said you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker use a pair of headphones etc this device wasn t made for taking pictures it has a front and back camera but they aren t designed to be spectacular i m not using them i find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands i think that s partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick also i do have some hand problems similar to someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome i think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives i m still waiting for it i m greatly enjoying this device it s simply fun to use the tablet there are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use amazon services if you don t typically use amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the internet and you re looking for a low price tag this device may be ok for you,20
this little sorcerer s box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors,20
bought this tablet for my mom who struggles with technology the fire hd was easy to setup and has many great features she is catching on well and learning new applications daily a great value,20
no instructions on adding the memory card and how to move things to the card vs on internally,20
great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on black friday,20
love the amazon alexa products i have show echo dots and the tap wish the tap had the drop in feature the tap does make a sound when you have the hands free enabled and say alexa instead of the blue lights on the other products great for taking outside,20

having an assistant like echo makes life so much easier,20
the best tablet for kids the year unlimited apps is my favorite my kids love it,20

i purchased of these fire hd tablets as gifts they pack a lot of punch for the price i helped set them up so i was able to get an idea of how they are going to work the screen was very nice and clear speed of tablet was good it is easy to use if you are already in the amazon family through prime it is a no brainer i don t believe you can get a better tablet at this price point,20
i love it i can call and do video camaras hear music,20
originally i bought this for my and year olds they loved it and so did i so many things to do on them and so much of what they love i now got it as well for my year old the best part of it all is the cases come with the tablets and they have colors to choose from so perfect for me,20
i m an amazon prime member and the show is awsum i use it to communicate with the son who lives in seattle you can watch amazon pirime tv play amazon music text play games read the lyrics while the song is playing i love it,20
excellent for what you pay and always good shopping at bestbuy,20
i ve bought several kindles for my grandkids they all enjoy them we use it for the library and download into overdrive and there are so many free games kids love this,20
granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday,20
i love this tablet it is the right size and i love playing movies on it,20
my granddaughter loves her pink tablet she is four and able to use on her own,20
so many things you can use it for love working my lights,20
they are both responsive to each other and it gives me convenience i don t have to turn off the lights and all i do is lay down and ask alexa to turn off the light all my lights are connected to my echo plus,20
great overall would be nice to have parental controls though,20
this tab is great for kids and parents alike i recommend this product to others,20
i can see my grandchildren when i call it is a great machine,20
purchased for my grandson he loves it when setting up be sure to update the software,20
simply love it it s loud love watching videos,20
it great just a little small then what i would like it have been,20
easy to use great cover and a lot of options for app games my daughter loves it,20
love this tablet it does everything i need it to my problem is i have family that falls in love with it so i give mine away if this wasn t good i wouldn t be on my rd one the only thing i would change is the silly ads and even worse browser other than that a solid product,20
i already have amazon devices echo s and dot s i expected this device to be slightly different as it is the only amazon device i have with a screen i was pleasantly surprised at the large number of helpful features that a screen could bring it occasionally scrolls suggestions across the screen and most of them have been very helpful i m planning on setting another one up at my year old mothers house she ll get a kick out of it also,20
i talk myself into the g and i am so glad i did i have used only kindles for the past years and i love them i love the color as well,20
i didn t know what i was missing out on until i got an echo plus,20
this was a gift that i gave to my daughter at our family christmas party she loves it especially the ease of set up and the attached hub so she can control her lights her nest thermostat this has also gone over well with the grand children,20
i have enjoyed using the fire hd it is fast and easy to use i also appreciate all the things it will do,20
i bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son it s fast and easy to use,20
has been very durable with kids and easy to use great product for price,20
tablet is very easy to use and navigate the internet,20
this was an upgrade from my amazon inch bigger screen was the key for me it s great for listening to music reading books watching movies tv sports tv shows and playing all the games hours of relaxation and entertainment along with amazon s new alexa,20
my family love alexa and so happy not having to buy any cd or another radio again,20
the ultimate bluetooth speaker i have multiple amazon echos and a whole echo system set up in my house i love everything amazon i can t stand apple but now i know how they feel i am a cult member of amazon lol so anyway i have been trashing this device the tap because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things i like most about the echo the only flaw of the echo is it is not portable i tried the triby but i did not like it more for little kids so on black friday the amazon tap was on super sale so i bought it the tap is smaller than i thought it was about rd the size of the echo which is perfect for portability but don t let the size fool you the sound is only short of bose when it comes to volume and sound quality important note you don t have to have an echo to use this device just the alexa app on your smart phone the tap does everything the echo does it is an amazing bluetooth speaker and it s portable automatically switches remembers different wifi areas and can be used with a hot spot the most amazing thing about the whole amazon echo system is that amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does some things even better than google now and light years ahead of siri the tap is my new favorite device it is perfect the only flaw is that it is not waterproof amazon if you are listening make the next tap waterproof,20
these things are cool with the new muti room music options i can have the same song playing in each room not to mention the intercom great item,20
small enough to carry every where when he is using it you can hear a pin drop,20
it was all that my grandson wanted and didn t have to search everywhere to find it,20
i have really enjoyed learning about the product and its many uses i thought initially music but now to get weather updates news receipies sports scores and ordering kitchen supplies,20
easy to set up plus the screen is very clear and easy to view,20
already had and when these when bb had a big sale price i couldn t order it fast enough i can see my nest cameras another product make video calls to other show owners voice calls to anyone else except and a whole host of skills that are being added almost daily my only regret is not replacing my remaining echo dots when they were on sale i won t make that mistake on next big sale i also received of the other home assistants included as free bonuses for buying a couple of other things i thought that it was only fair to compare the two disregarging the video aspects of show amazon s shows and dots echos were like comparing lambourgini to a vw bug setting up these things are like the expression i heard as a kid easier than fallin of a log and not near as dangerous,20
tablet works will with amazon video on our smart tvs as well as the firesticks,20
works like a dream use it daily phone feature is really cool like it,20
bought one to replace the smaller non hd version lot faster and picture is noticeably better would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra or so on the big names,20
absolutely love kindle kids edition easy to use great apps and love it comes with year warranty must have for my kids,20
not sure why but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it very disappointing,20
what i expected a better then budget tablet ata good price bought for the integration with alexa and it works well more info about your alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet,20
i am enjoying my kindle very much easy to down load books and easy to read very happy with my purchase,20
my kid loves this it was one of his favorite christmas presents,20
i got this for a friends son the only problem with it is he won t put it down lol,20
i previously owned a nucleus device which was similar to this device but was not a great device and had a lot of bugs and did not do much so i returned it this device is a masterpiece not only is it tied into the alexa echo universe it can be used as an intercom throughout your house with other echos and also can be used to view things and even call people that have echo directly it is an amazing piece of hardware and amazon should be proud of themselves for developing such a beautiful device,20
ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it larger screen and colored case are a big plus,20
best electronic i purchased for myself this year great price too,20
i love this and it s great for kids got it for a early christmas gift for a friends son and he loves it,20
wife love it reads a lot and this is her go to reader,20
this is not an upgrade by any means my three year old kindle outperformed oasis battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak two pieces to keep up with unsnaps constantly amazon customer services promises it will resolved in an update,20
overall it is a good tablet but i am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and amazon app store,20
easy to handle light weight i like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed,20
convenient easy to use and grand kids all have one too,20
requires too many components cameras etc stick with basics in my opinion,20
love the choice of colors have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift,20
this item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing the only con is that amazon doesn t have some of the apps that google play has,20
my children love these kindles they are so much better then the st ones we had the price is better as well,20
we have always been nexus tablet desciples and in fact have bought of them for self and family members this one was for granddaughter to replace nexus that had gotten slow this one works better faster than the nexus it s fast easy to use perfect tablet for a child or teenager and can t beat the price very pleased with purchase,20
echo show not only plays your music it puts up the lyrics to read from,20
i upgraded to have more memory and this is a great little tablet works great and does everything i need it to do,20

i got it for me and my brother for christmas great gift great price very functional,20
got this tablet for my year old son and he can not put it down it is so much to do so many learning games i love this product,20
the kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu,20
i purchased this for my father in law and it works perfect for him good product for the price,20
nice device good to enable drop in conversations some flash briefings but overall still a little limited in effective use of video,20
works great i bought for the kitchen and for master bath,20
i bought it as a gift for my parents and they absolutely love it,20
i love hear readers i had to replace mine because i destroyed the last but it is awesome,20
i bought this for my daughter it s a little limited in what it can do but she loves it she s a little too young to understand the games but she loves watching cartoons on it,20
i bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips,20
i was resistant to putting down my real books and begin using a kindle i m so glad i did it s so convenient to shop and instantly download a book plus no more storing hundreds on books in my house,20
the amazon fire tablets are nice tablets they re especially great for streaming tv and movies and since it s a kindle it s great for books too it is a little odd with the internet browser and still a little limited in the app store but overall a great little tablet,20
my daughter absolutely love her tablet and i love it to for her it s very kids friendly,20
it works well and sounds decent but the hub portion of this is not as easy to use as samsung,20
the tablet works well and the silicon pumper cover is great for gripping,20
it freezes a lot lots of problems getting games to cooperate but overall my son loves it,20
my wife and i love the amazon echo plus it s very easy to control the hue lights in the house that we have set up i would recommend this to anybody we love it we also play a lot of music on it,20
this is my second one and must have one of these at all times,20
great speaker able to move around connect to ipad when watching movies love it,20
replaced my hd fire because broke screed very pleased with the large screen,20
i purchased two of these for my kids ages and forget the ipod touch for the price this tablet can t be beat they can download games books and movies for free all included with my amazon prime membership awesome,20
i bought this tablet for it s inexpensive price and quality it s meant to be a portal to be able to purchase more products from amazon and services but it really is a high quality product,20
i got this tablet for my mother and cousins it s been very speedy to my surprise not as fast as a high end tablet but no lag and a very nice p display with good build quality would definitely recommend if your looking for an affordable tablet,20
great buy after owning the original kindle fire it s very versatile and shows the progress made from the original you can t lose and pair it with amazon prime,20
nice easy to use tablet we just got it and so far so good,20
my wife purchased this for my daughter great for learning to read,20
i love amazon products easy to use and install i recommend them very good sound and above all price,20
it s the perfect tablet for a kid to watch cartoons and play games the protection is awesome,20
i didn t think i would like the echo show especially at the price point but i tried it and love it if i could afford it and if they would add an audio port i would replace my current alexas with echo shows,20
this is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device,20
i got the first version for my sister and she hasn t been able to put it down on over a year then i got her this one and forget about it great new features she loves loves loves it,20
we bought three including one for my year old we all love it the only complaint is the volume there is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers it doesn t bother us too much but that s why we give it stars overall a great tablet,20
bought this for a gift for some one who s old tablet won t work just the right size to play games on,20
the tablet with an added protective case has so far held up better than other tablets i have tried and the parental controls are great i can also add educational apps that i want,20
my son loves his kindle fire tablet it is perfect,20
i enjoy alexa she reminds me of appointment and alerts me when my packages arrive,20
we have sonos speakers and a honeywell lyric thermostat it took a little searching on google to get things linked now that they are linked we can play music in any room and change our home temperature by using alexa,20
the alexa show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that i had in the older device i m not sure if i m missing it in the show but i was able to get internet cameras on the older device such as san diego zoo elephants that you can t get on the show while certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch setup was pretty straight forward and easy it is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent it is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want such as play or start or open i use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then more or other combination you would have to set up several different alarms one for each day as far as i can see some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming i don t really want to be terrified awake each day i found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well it would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you d like i don t see that yet anywhere another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off if you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times i d rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe which is possible but very sensitive and if you miss here comes snooze just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly i am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so i can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time hoping that works well when it arrives it will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed all in all i d say it s a good emerging technology but needs a little work considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago it s kind of where we re heading,20
kinda bummed didn t realize i bought the package and didn t get my extra phillips hue bulb but i love the echo plus with the hub great product just annoyed that the sales guy at best buy didn t make sure i knew i also got a free bulb with my purchase,20
i saw this product used by friends and was so impressed i bought one for my husband for christmas,20
it very convenient it small and it work awesome can put in my purse or,20
this was purchased for my older grandson age for christmas and as i stated in another review it has had games downloaded on it and will be ready to use when it is opened by him,20
nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity,20
love using this kindle to look up real estate sales play mind games and take pictures love the bigger screen and the great resolution sound is also far superior to my older model lindle,20
this is a nice little tablet for me since i don t do a lot on a tablet it s a great size it took a little getting use to working with but am a little more comfortable with it now,20
my son is and loves it it s very easy to use,20
it s alright to browse the internet and watch videos,20
i purchase this tablet for my daughter s birthday and she absolutely loves it i am very pleased that she s not able to get online or to get on youtube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can t get into it i would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the google play store since it is an amazon tablet,20
the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale,20
we returned it could not give answers to our questions even though the answers were easily found on google,20
i m not a techie but after days of trying to hook up i gave up i don t know if it was the echo plus or my carrier att uverse causing the issue but it would not connect so back to the store it went even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistance none of it worked,20
perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane,20
couldn t recommend this more for kids price and features are awesome along with parental controls,20
amazon keeps getting better tablet now has option to move icons set wallpaper and more with added sd card option is even better,20
bought if for my year old son has plenty of space long battery life it s durable and hasn t broke when dropped i m going to buy a case though,20
seems a lot better does not have the open cover feature which i miss but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that i had on the old,20
using the kindle to read books and stream videos is very easy and enjoyable,20
works very well cheaper than an ipad and works great for apps and video,20
my fire is compact and easy to use mainly used to read online books at lunch time the battery lasts much longer than previous tablet i had and charges much quicker very happy with my fire,20
this is the best assistant from amazon with the completion of the screen you can also see images from cameras and other devices simply awesome,20
the best product for the money east to use great color great features easy to set up and battery life is great,20
good small tablet for all purposes for reading playing games,20
bought this for my year old he loves it and it s very simple to add the perfect parental controls,20
through all of my research this was the best value for what i was looking for in an e reader with additional options i was not sure i would use or not turns i do because of the ease of usage,20
i bought this for my mom she enjoys checking her email and facebook she enjoys playing games most of all,20
the amazon echo show is so much fun i got it for my husband for christmas and its absolutely more of a gift for myself we also got hue lights and have set it up our routines this show is so much fun we listen to the news in the morning while making coffee it wakes us up with slowly with the hue lights we listen to music while cooking dinner cant recommend it more because of this purchase i am also buying a spot we love the camera feature where you can drop in so we will continue buying these rather than the security cameras for the inside at least where we just want to say hello or see our dog,20
we use alexa for so many things we use it for shopping list music lights on or off even trivia games,20
i love my echo show elexa is so helpfull she answers just about every question i have,20
this is the best device i have found for my e books i know it can be used for a lot more but it is my library in my hand,20
we love alexa love being able to watch news briefings seeing the lyrics to songs and so much more it s in our kitchen and we use it everyday,20
speaker is pretty loud and i love that i can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the home button to use alexa,20
bought of these for my and yr old and it said it came with gb storage but actual storage was a little less cant remember exactly how much probably around gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre installed they mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them there is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera love the product comes in different color as well i got the blue,20
was told by sales person i could come back in a week with receipt to get off black friday price customer service lady said they don t do that i was misled item itself is okay,20

the graphics and sound on this tablet were better than expected,Positive
i got oasis yesterday very lighweight compared to voyager screen size comparable like having actual page turn button touchscreen seems kinda slow the on off button on top is improvement from back of voyager cover does seem kind of flimsy but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up finding it easier to hold with cover on then removed cover doesn t have separate charge port so all charging is done thru kindle,Positive
got it for few weeks but it kind of fades away from your life,Positive
i bought this tablet for my year old daughter too many advertisements i would rather pay more and not have a single ad,Negative
we were interested in the echo line of products after we purchased our vivint security system the echo show is a perfect addition we are able to view our security cameras from the the echo show and it works great in general as an echo with all its features,Positive
this is a great tablet for kids as it is not too expensive and there is a year warranty if it breaks within years they replace it my year is very rough with things my husband was letting him plug the charger in by himself and jammed it into the tablet causing the charging port to break i had no problems getting it replaced,Positive

this is my first tablet love it actually read my first e book on it large screen easy to read play games fits nicely in my purse,Positive
upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras sound is much better,Positive
with the cover attached the battery lasts for a good long period with the cover detached which is how i use it primarily the oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand the ability to switch hands flip upside down means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book and it fits into my pants pocket again perfect for traveling the battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days but i tend to reconnect the cover at night i am assuming that helps to recharge the basic oasis battery regardless it was well worth replacing our older kindle readers with the newer oasis we bought two,Positive
great tablet perfect for my year old son,Positive
good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn,Positive
like it better then the nabi jr more like a real tablet actually it is with the extra protective case,Positive

its a great product but for the cost the speakers are not what they should be and the screen is too small choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot i am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance,Neutral

i read a huge number of books in kindle format this kindle fire is perfect for that it s just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying it also is great for audible users you will want to install a micro sd card though you can also use it to watch netflix and the like although i don t as a tablet it leaves a lot to be desired if you are looking for a tablet give this a pass it has a lot of system lag and wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal also you should know that you can t access any apps on the google play store it s locked into amazon none of that bothers me because like i said i only use it to read listen to kindle books and this device works perfectly for that bottom line if you just want a kindle reading platform with some extra functionality this will work well for you if you re looking for the full android tablet experience look elsewhere,Positive
my echo show is my christmas gift to myself so far i am having great fun with this nifty new addition to my amazon family of home monitoring devices i have connected the show to my ring doorbell,Positive

i bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices my mother bought him a subscription to the abc mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on at first i was skeptical about spending the extra for the kids fire as i thought it was mainly for the case which i thought to be cheap silicon when the tablet arrived in the mail i was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick heavy duty type of foam it provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops it booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child s account the child s account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don t want them to get a hold of you can set time limits on their account to your desire you can allow and disallow any application you want to their account it comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited which i interpreted as basically prime for kids this allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want the kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate he is able to one click to any apps books games he wants to use it also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top overall i m very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the internet holds if you re not careful,Positive

i bought this after i bought the amazon echo this was actually an impulse buy i saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it because i enjoyed the echo so much it does everything the echo does but the sound quality is not great when you re playing at middle volume it s ok the lows are there but doesn t sound good i m guessing i m comparing it with the bose mini soundlink when you set the volume high the bass is almost non existent the mids and highs are loud with the louder volume another difference is that with tap you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands i do like the fact that it s portable because of that i m on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass,Positive
i love my amazon fire hd it s not too small and not too big i was looking at other tablets and decided on the amazon fire hd because of the price and because i have amazon prime i purchased it online at best buy and then picked it up at the store on black friday it is my first tablet and so i wanted to start with one that i can have fun with and i am i do have a laptop for important things,Positive

the color is what got me and the features was on point the screen shows a lot of different displays to share for now until the next one,Positive
the tablet is pretty good i would give it stars if you are able to download an use apps from the google store that is one of my only big complaint and also how fast the sd card got filled with items from amazon os that s on the tablet without the user knowing on the other hand with four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful,Neutral
my first ebook reader read some reviews decided to go with this because of the backlight and adaptive light sometimes i have to adjust the light manually but no biggie quick and easy on the eyes,Positive

setting up the amazon show was a little tricky but i managed to navigate through it it s so cool to add compatible equipment,Positive
tablet is great for kids and adult use i purchased the tablet to use at school with students with disabilities the tablet holds up well holds a charge throughout the week the tablet offers games that do not require wi fi or data if you have a prime membership there are a lot of benefits when using the fire for example free apps free streaming movies music etc,Positive
great item would definitely recommend this item am still learning all the things about it,Positive

it was great product the price which i got it was great,Neutral
we have two echo ourselves and purchased this as a gift for someone we have smart plugs for our lamps that alexa turns on off,Positive
it does everything amazon and i can even see who is at the front door with arlo it doesn t do netflix or hulu but that s okay i really like the sound it fills small rooms it s easy now to video chat with nana or drop in to tell my kid s goodnight when i am working late,Positive

best kindle charger ever took minutes to being my kindle back to life,Positive
i loved the amazon echo but to be able to see so much more on the screen is amazing i highly recommend,Positive
i love the alexa system of assistance this version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won t get to have to the option to pick up you need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private i installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use,Positive
i ve had kindles for years and this latest one is also right up at the top,Positive
bought for my year old and she loves it haven t had any issues,Positive
great product loving alexa was so happy with it that know its a big part of all that i do,Positive
i would highly recommend the kindle fire for a first time user it was really very easy to learn to navigate,Positive
i have both the kindle voyage and the low end kindle fire while the fire is an amazing deal for serious readin g the kindle voyage is far easier on the eyes and has superior resolution now it lacks many of the features of the less expensive fire such as color and online with wifi as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure truthfully it isn t a whole lot better than the paperwhite it has a feature or two but i m not sure it s worth the extra dollars it is still an excellent device,Positive
i recently had purchased enough smart home devices to make this a good addition for the home it works well with smart outlets our ring doorbell and fairly well with our nest thermostat my only complaint is that sometimes for no reason it will start plying a movie trailer and it s hard to get it to stop still all in all we re happy with the purchase,Positive

fantastic product and does exactly as described great gift idea,Positive
with this you can make calls to other echo shows or using the app you can call others that have the a show i haven t used this feature yet since i m the only one i know who has one i can tell you that while using the app at home or away from home off the network you can call the show i did this while at work to check it out and caught my son coming in the back door i freaked him out but after he settled down we chatted via video chat for awhile and both agreed it was awesome you could also just drop into the show from the app to check on the house or whatever wherever you have it keep in mind you re only gonna see what it s pointed at the camera doesn t move plus in its natural form it is tilted back slightly so it point upward there are stands on amazon the correct the tilt to make it straight up and down almost forgot but the speakers are amazing you can link multiple echos together to play music i have the show in my living room an echo in my bedroom and the dot connected to a jbl speaker in another room after set up through the app i can tell alexa to play music and they all come to life,Positive
i tryed the gb to see if it was any different from the gb and found little difference may hold more apps,Positive

my year old son really enjoys the tablet it s great,Positive
i enjoy my kindle immensely so much better than having to start up my computer,Positive
this does the same stuff as the traditional echo or echo dot except it has a screen if you already liked the echo s this is a good addition the addition of the screen is neat but certainly not essential you can see daily news headlines and the weather scroll across the screen you can watch any arlo or similar cameras on it you can watch youtube and amazon video as well but you ll probably just watch that on a phone tablet or tv instead,Positive
the best part about the echo is that you can actually use it to watch videos the security cameras connected to your house listen to music and watch the baby sleep i love my echo show,Positive
has everything you will ever need inside for children and adultsa,Positive

got this to replace the samsung tab a that samsung tab lagged a lot but i haven t seemed to have as much problems on the fire tab the only downside is that the battery dies fast,Positive
this was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books couple this with amazon gift cards and the library is endless,Positive
i wish i could just say it is one of my best investment i love the fact that now i don t have to drag around several of my favorite books i can now have them all in one convenient place the battery life is great my little girl loves that she can play games on it i think it s great i should have gotten more memory though,Positive

i had an alexa but thought the show would be cool as it would allow me to link a camera to it see videos for info i wanted to look up play my prime video account it would have been a if i could see all prime shows movies on it,Positive
killer tablet for the price no issues running any apps or programs,Positive
my wife loves to read but she was always hesitant to try ebooks she used to think that ebooks could never have the same tactile feel as a physical book i talked her into it by telling her its lighter easier to hold can hold thousands of books and if she hated it we can return it but she loves ebooks now and doesnt want to go back she also found out that amazon has a lot of books which cost nothing namely classics and such i think if you like to read in the dark then get the paperwhite version the led s are a nice touch,Positive
once taking time to install google play store it functioned as good as any other android tablet the down side is camera which doesn t produce clear pictures,Positive
great notepad huge screen and easily downloaded apps to use love it,Positive
i bought this for my wife this is her third amazon fire tablet she mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one she s very happy with it,Positive
excellent product turns on and off supported devices by asking it live walking into a room and asking alexa to turn on a light poof it s done or locking and unlocking the front door arming and disarming my security system if you re looking to turn your house into a smarthome i strongly recommend the amazon echo plus,Positive

so i bought my little guys these tablets so that i could repossess my ipad love the free time app but who could ve imagined they wouldn t play netflix so now i m out the money for the tablet and still don t have my ipad back and yes i called amazon numerous times they work after the fix but the next time they go to use them they don t work again the fix takes several minutes as it s force stopping the app clearing cache then doing a hard restart then you have to wait to restart netflix oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works if it works at all,Negative
great for first time tablet but more advanced options available,Neutral
good age appropriate learning tool for kids there is a variety of apps kids can download to keep them from getting bored overall a good tablet for the kids,Positive
i like my show but i can t say i love it for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices it has probably the worst microphone getting it to respond is frustrating at times where i have no problem with a standard echo besides this it all works as advertised i d wait for the second generation i m sure they can work the kinks out,Neutral

i have always been a nook customer but recently their models have not received good feedback so while shopping for a new ereader i had to make the decision between the two the biggest influence behind price while the new samsung model of the nook definitely looks great it also has a big price tag overall we are very happy with this purchase it is mostly used as an ereader but we have downloaded a few games kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader,Positive

love this product able to read recipes instead of just hearing them speaker is pretty good too,Positive
for me this tablet is an extremely good value ipads are beautiful things and they seem to just work really well all the time but they are expensive same thing with android tablets you can get a cheap android tablet but then you re left with a cheap tablet poor quality displays questionable hardware limited support i think amazon hit the spot with their line of fire tablets this hd in particular it s good quality has a great display it s quick and snappy has great battery life also being an android based operating system there is flexibility like accessing storage side loading third party apps even installing google play for those who begrudge the lack of that feature it can be done much more flexibility than you get with an apple product at a much lower price than the industry standard samsung etc coming from using apple products for so long this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than apple and especially for the price its a great introduction to a different platform not only that it s genuinely a good product,Positive

runs great very efficient for what we use it for,Positive
alexa is now a family member how have i lived my life without her i have no idea,Positive
it s a nice upgrade from the screen size is just right for small kids hands reading kindle books is much easier,Positive
got this tablet for my yr old daughter and it has been great for her it s the right size for her little hands only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it apps have to be from amazon and they might not have the app you want,Positive
difficult to purchase no stock in stores no order online or ship to store available when it did become available it did not work once it turned on i couldn t get any further i could not log onto wifi network though other items in my household work also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock tried days gave up and returned the item,Negative
fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well good tablet for books and games for all the family,Positive
this has kept my kids entertained but maybe just a little too entertained sadly they don t want to do much else,Positive
if you like to control smart gadgets this is definitely for you,Positive
they make it seem like you can pretty much ask anything to alexa but she never knows anything it is very non responsive at times too,Neutral
it was all that my grandson wanted and didn t have to search everywhere to find it,Positive
this was the perfect gift for grandkids i bought one in pink and one in green so each grandchild would have their own color lots of games come with the tablet and additional games and videos can be added,Positive
this little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming my kids have quickly learned that alexa is their personal dj when hooked up to the amazon prime unlimited music program battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass but it does the job for our family,Positive
my grandson takes it on trips and he loves it it s easy to use,Positive
i was jealous when our son showed us his amazon show and some of the things it was capable of doing since aol eliminated instant messaging my wife and i were less able to communicate because our offices are on separate floors so we got two shows and two spots and now not only can intercom easily but use alexa for music and many other things we will probably start using some smart home devices which alexa can also control it s a fun device which seems to be getting better all the time,Positive
i have an old kindle touch the last one that still had text to voice which no longer works i decided to upgrade started reading the reviews was enticed by the the kindle voyage and took the plunge the voyage is pretty and sleek with neat features and i enjoyed using it for a few days but my frugal self just couldn t justify the price difference between it and the paperwhite while the ambient light sensor was nice i often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room i made more errors of turning a page than i meant to with the page turn because of where the page turn spots are located plus i m in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet so i kept swiping despite the availability of page turn however the clarity of the screen the quality of the light the form factor the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice nonetheless the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the paperwhite the thing i miss most about the voyage is the quality of the light and how even the lighting is on it the unit i had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the voyage i purchased the newest model of the paperwhite and i like it but the lighting appears pretty dingy however it s only when they re compared side to side that i wished i wasn t so cost conscious if money is not an object i d say get the kindle voyage if it is the paperwhite is a fine little reader and overall i m happy i have it,Positive
i personally love this because i can bring it every where i go and sing and its fun,Positive
works great for everything we want our daughter to do,Positive
awesome product my wife and i love it makes home automation simple,Positive
i bought this for controlling most of my smart device,Positive
i purchased this kindle for my wife because her kindle fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the fire since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus the main drawback is that the graphics aren t as clear with this reader all in all it was money well spent,Positive
i love being able to use alexa she is an amazing ai until the robots rebel against the human kind i think it s worth it,Positive
i ve wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when bb put it on sale i am not disappointed,Positive
works great can t wait to find all it can do for me,Positive
it did exactly what it s suppose to and i m still learning new features a month after having it very good decice,Positive
love the sound i am able to plug in a lamp in a hard to reach spot since it is now voice activated,Positive
gift was on point recipient was very pleased would recommend to others,Positive
this is a great product i also have a dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus the hands free mode works just like the dot and the sound is great i use the tap all the time working on projects making shopping lists playing games to turning on the lights i looked at the echo but even with a battery pack it didn t seem very mobile,Positive
have been pleased with my purchase of the fire hd as it s video quality is great when viewing espn netflix youtube tutorials the ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the amazon kindle app is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an ipad,Positive
this is a must have is great for recepies while you are cooking alexa gives you the info for the ines that are used to a tablet or ipod that you have to stop and read this is awesome plus so much easier to follow things,Positive
very kid friendly especially for toddlers and easy to use,Positive
wanted to expand alexa into multiple rooms of the house this device added easily into the system and can now listen to music in multiple rooms,Positive
i like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports etc still not using it to its full potential but we have it controlling a couple of lamps giving us weather reports setting timers and alarms it s making me lazy sometimes it doesn t hear my voice hears my husband s voice better i find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table,Positive
child loves it can be used for more than just a time killer can learn from it,Positive
it is so fun to talk to alexa the sound is also very high quality i am very happy with my purchase,Positive

i use this thing every night to fall asleep although alexa don t always understand me i still love the device,Positive
i thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm i think it is too small to read on it not very comfortable as regular kindle would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead,Neutral
got it for my grandson he loves it it is a very good tablet,Positive
the only thing i would say is that you have to do a work around for direct tv other that that it is great,Positive
we have been using our kindle fire for years and it wore out we looked at replacing it with another fire until i saw the fire the display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference,Positive
purchased for my husband but this is more a gift for the entire family luv the display,Positive
this device is alot better than the small alexa did everything i wanted it to,Positive

fits easily into my purse or bag small compact,Positive
our whole family loves and uses this device for so many different features we love using it to make phone calls watch films play jeopardy even to define words as they come up in conversation we definitely get a lot of use out of this device more than any other screen tablet or smart phone device we own,Positive
upgraded my year old kindle same old doesnt seem that great of a difference the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading,Neutral
so i was skeptical of echo show and the entire line to be honest however this technology has changed how our household operates from my daily briefing in the morning to tracking santa with my year old every morning learning interesting facts about santa and several other things i truly wish i would have bought this sooner we have it integrated into our cozi account so we can just ask alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in we also have adt pulse and a nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple i couldn t believe it my son loves to ask alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is i am loving the amazon music now as well because we bought an echo dot just to integrate into our bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now if you are on the fence about getting the echo show like i was just do it it really is an amazing product,Positive

when it works it s great but for some reason it doesn t always answer me when it doesn t answer me i turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn t work at that time it was easy to set up with the phone app doesn t seem to matter where the phone is when it isn t working i ve tried close and far and in between so a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn t,Neutral
she knows all the answers i m used to speaking to her i recently visiting a friend and said alexa and my friend looked at me like i was crazy she doesn t have alexa,Positive
i gave this amazon fire hd as a retirement gift for my friend and she absolutely loves it,Positive
your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps videos and the internet you can not get a better deal the yr anything happens warranty is a big plus it s not the fastest thing on the market it s desent picture quality is great everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy love the fact that i can program it to have her read mins st before she can fully access it also that i can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week,Positive
my wife loves this tablet much easier to use than previous tablets that we purchased,Positive
alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated,Neutral

i loved this tablet i did but i did not love that i was being sold ads every time i powered up i loathe even more that i would have had to pay to discontinue that feature amazon if you want dollars for the kindle fire charge it but don t under price the device and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity it is unbecoming of you i returned this item pronto,Negative
haven t been able to train alexa like we ve heard probably our own fault we have fun with it,Positive
great alternative to using tablet for reading only problem is trying to read a pdf file it only enlarges the page and does not resize the document to easily move forward,Positive
my mom bought the tablets first for my sisters for christmas an then my year old wanted one so i purchased one for her she loves it uses it for games netflix an she is home school so she is able to do her work on the tablet as well,Positive
the amazon tap is a perfect complement to our amazon echo put this in our office space has all the advantages of the echo and is also a great bluetooth speaker having to tap the mic button to summon alexa is no issue at all sound quality is as good as any bluetooth speaker on the market and it s extremely portable,Positive
the show is a great little product it has opened a lot of doors in the world of ai and home automation for me it connected easily with my echo and dot and now i can stream music all over my house the picture quality is outstanding the only drawback is that alexa doesn t have a very strong internet search engine,Positive
great screen resolution and easy to use battery life is really good,Positive

great tablet and price ordering online easy not happy took so long to receive though,Positive
this tablet is great for trips just make sure you download games and shows on it first since it does not have internet the case is great for kids who are rough with technology it really takes a beating,Positive

size brightness and convenience are good the option to link with android products for messages is a little hard,Positive
i bought this as a backup i am currently using the same headphone,Positive
bought for our son so he wouldn t have to carry books back from his deployment,Positive
i think the price is great the durability the easiness although you do need to spend money as well for extra better games and the charger breaks easily but u can use any android charger overall well worth the price i believe,Positive
we gave this tablet to our nine year old grandaughter for her birthday she loves it and we feel it is very sturdy that is a very good thing when it comes to tablets and children,Positive
this ia a great product more technology to make your life easier,Positive
this is my eighth kindle some others were either lost or screen damaged i bought it as a spare current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen great price also wish i d bought two,Positive
despite not being able to get one of these from amazon until late june due to apparent strong demand best buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release april well done best buy having owned several previous kindles including the most recent paperwhite model i was unprepared for how small and light this new oasis model is reading about it is one thing but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely the oasis and its battery charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest paperwhite with no case the oasis without its cover feels impossibly light at ounces size wise the oasis is nearly a square shape at about wide by tall in fact the shape is so different from traditional kindle designs that i had to compare it next to my paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size they are it s the first kindle i think i could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort for frequent travelers like me this is a key reason to buy one of these as it s extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse the screen is the first front lit kindle i ve ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the leds from any angle no dark spots no bright spots just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions the page also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface helping achieve the illusion of printed paper it s sharp and clear better than any kindle i ve used the reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart since they are held together with magnets after doing so this is where the amazon engineering team s achievements really become clear as you just won t believe how lightweight this thing is it s easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it degrees when switching the display instantly rotates and the page turn buttons also follow with the top button always used to advance the page and the bottom button always used to go backward you can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models the battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover s battery so it runs down faster if you don t have it connected to the case it s very easy to snap the reader back into its cover which allows it to recharge while you continue to read the power button and charge port are located in the upper top right corner more or less opposite from where they are on the paperwhite i find this location to be less awkward as it s easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge the back surface of the reader not the case seems to easily attract fingerprints and they are not so easy to clean off you d think that amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now it s a minor annoyance lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model s high price relative to other kindle models without ads it s vs for an ad less paperwhite is this a lot of money perhaps but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that s easy on both your arms and your eyes then i personally think it s worth it a lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit and the price reflects that is it for everyone probably not but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you ll have to wait to get one on amazon s website if you are a serious reader this device deserves a very close look i m definitely keeping mine,Positive
got one for my mom in order to video chat with her works awesome,Positive
easy to use and great selection of books movies and games,Positive
a great new amazon device to add to my other alexa products the visuals are amazing and it is so easy to use and set up,Positive

i love this tablet i got one for each one of the kids all different ages and they all love it,Positive
alexa makes my life easy by turning my lights on and off playing my favorite music and so much more it really can control anything,Positive
my kid love this tablet the setup was so easy and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps that my kid can enjoy playing and learning,Positive
it can stream music really well and not just from amazon i was expecting it to be smart like watson but it is more like an blank stare amazon should look into predicting questions like during superbowl play offs alexa was unable to display or update the play off brackets it understands my voice really well were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what i am saying it want pair to my portable bluetooth speaker it will pair to my cell phone but only to receive music from it the audio quality is varies with amplitude with low amplitudes alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room but an amplitude setting of about the audio becomes clear and understandable i really like playing games like jeopardy with alexa no climbing through the closet to find a box anymore and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing,Positive
was good price wish it had google play download on to it,Positive
we love the parent controls and durability we would definitely buy another,Positive
this was one of the best birthday presents i ever purchased for my husband he said he doesn t use the computer but he was on my smartphone daily viewing fb i got him a drone for christmas and he needed something to view while it is flying i researched the kindle fire and thought he could practice with it until spring he farms so isn t busy in the winter thank goodness because he is busy with his kindle for hours every day he thinks it is great and i do too because now i have my phone back,Positive
i bought this as a gift for my daughter s nd birthday and she totally loved it now she s wanting me to buy a second one so that i can keep it on the first floor she says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other i think it was a great purchase so i think i m going to have to buy another one,Positive

great product for a very good price loved this tablet,Positive
love my kendal but cannot find a case or screen saver for it,Positive
i waited a couple months to review giving amazon time to make this product equal to the sony dash from nearly a decade ago it isn t the screen provides nothing of value and you can t turn of amazon tips you have near zero customization can t even move the clock to the other side of the screen and something that a sony dash did nearly years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm seriously this is the biggest fail run away from this half baked amazon disaster,Negative
durable worth every penny got it for our year old daughter amazed how easily she can navigate it,Positive
bought of these for my and yr old and it said it came with gb storage but actual storage was a little less cant remember exactly how much probably around gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre installed they mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them there is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera love the product comes in different color as well i got the blue,Positive

my nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift kindle suits it well for him to learn and study,Positive
this is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price i bought this when it is on sale for for gb sd card you have a great tablet when plenty of space i used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced this tablet is a deal,Positive
quite an upgrade from the original fire the deletion of the carousel was a welcome change the new turn style approach is faster and more consice still don t know why a chime sounds also miss the ease of making notes while reading there has got to be a better way to organize books trying to figure out series trilogies etc is impossible and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that amazon won t pick up a new purchase as a book already read,Positive
purchased for an year old that wanted this badly appears to be rugged links up with my amazon account for content and access year warranty win,Positive
this is my second kindle have a few more items to learn but love it easy to get around the apps,Positive
great product for when you are on the go great sound,Positive
the echo show is a great accessory to any house it has a great picture on it and great sound it s simple to use my wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists also listens to music with crisp sound can ask alexa pretty much anything,Positive
really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter learning i do wish it had more storage and more items for kids but we do love the tablet,Positive
i bought this for my grandson and it hasn t disappointed me at all he loves his tablet i am looking at buying his sister one next,Positive

i really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well,Positive
this is my second fire wanted a larger size to make ebooks easier to read very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet easy to take along in a tote perfect for what i wanted it for,Positive
we own an ipad samsug tablets and we have both love are fire s wave better,Positive
i love everything about this alexa if you re on the fence just buy it it does everything,Positive
this is my second kindle fire and i have been extremely pleased with them both this second one is much more versatile and i love it,Positive
easy access to book reader love watching my netflix con slow getting on internet,Positive
purchased this for my wife during christmas and got a great deal on it compared to the older version that she has this model is faster brighter and more convenient with alexa i would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it,Positive
this tablet has beautiful color graphics and is super thin easy to carry with you,Positive
the echo plus is a fantastically easy to use smarthome hub it is easy to setup fast and responsive has a ton of capabilities that are expanding daily and looks and sounds great i currently use mine to manage my smart things like light bulbs lamps smart switches and even my robot vac it has made automating a lot of what i do daily a breeze and has simplified my life where i didn t know it needed to be simplified definitely worth the extra money to go with the plus over the echo or the dot,Positive
great price on a good tablet especially on black friday,Positive
bought for my son works great great tablet for the,Positive
bought for daughter in law and she likes it she wanted a fire,Positive
this is excellent for toddlers and also as they grow numerous things they can do on it and also nice to be abke to control it as a parent,Positive
this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s in but this is about cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s was not doing it for me,Positive
screen is really nice great for videos i would definetly recommend it,Positive
new kindle fire is easy to setup great for reading no issues at all when trying to connect to my home network i would recommend this item for anyone who wants to read and get on the internet,Positive
i love this tablet it s the perfect size for my kid keeps him entertained during long trips we picked up the free time kid proof case and it s perfect also,Positive
amazon echo show is the best of all my amazon products i love the hands free but able to see things on the screen,Positive
great looking display text is sharp and easy to read the lighting of screen is wonderful for reading in lower light environments this is a little more compact than the paper white model i really love the page press button areas makes it so you can turn pages without adjusting your hand as long as you are holding the voyage with your thumb resting in the button area sounds like a minor thing but to me it s a big convenience,Positive
this is a very good tablet the only con is you may have to reboot it too often,Positive
so my month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet however my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my ipad but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys which makes the kindle fire tablet for kids the best invention since the tivo all the pre loaded apps videos books etc is nothing short of amazing the case is also very cool hardwood floor and stair case proof for under bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine,Positive
i ve had lots of tablets in the past mostly from the samsung line but this is my first amazon fire so i want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these at the time that this was written alexa had not been added to the tablet first while this device runs an android type of operating system amazon puts its own spin on the operating system i don t feel like i m using android this feels different to me it doesn t have the same level of customization that android users have come to appreciate that being said if you are an amazon prime member this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine it s simply a fun way to consume your magazines books etc there are on screen buttons on the bottom of the device the middle button immediately takes you to your home screen the button to the left acts as a sort of back button it also lets me get rid of my keyboard when i don t need it on screen but it s open the button to the right is super important it took me a couple of days to realize what it does that square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open it lets you switch between apps but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out you can close them by pressing the x button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right if you leave all of those apps open and you never close them you ll drain your battery make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps the device has several menus that you swipe left to view first you start with your home screen you literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet all of your apps are housed here you swipe up to view all of them the tablet comes with several apps pre installed such as slik amazon s own internet browser audible good reads the amazon app store a weather app etc you can go to the amazon app store to download other apps such as twitter facebook etc you can combine the apps on this page into folders you just drag one app to another app and a folder appears this made my home screen much more manageable you can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings this feature doesn t necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps however i believe it only changes the font on your main screens if you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device when you have a new issues it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of new items the device comes with a free month subscription to the washington post you ll see that under new items when you initially activate your tablet you can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos you can do this through the settings menu on the device if you want to use one of your own photos however you need to either take it on the device or move it into amazon s photos app which is a cloud based app so far i haven t found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper i m not crazy about the amazon photo app i found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into amazon s cloud just so i could view them on my tablet that being said i m not planning to take photos on this device i just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper beyond the home screen you can swipe to the right to view your other screen they are pre arranged to be books videos games shop apps music audiobooks and newstand all of those screens are connected to your amazon account for example if you have kindle books you ve already purchased they automatically will appear under the books menu your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu there doesn t seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages that bugs me but it s not the end of the world there s also one menu to the left of the home menu it s the recent page it shows you what you ve received looked at on the tablet i never use it but it might be handy for some people one of my favorite features of this tablet is amazon s on deck capability if you re an amazon prime member amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like the items don t count against your pre installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full you can turn off the on deck feature if you don t like it i ve been content with the video playback capability this isn t my major use of the device but the images look fine and the audio is ok i ll talk more about the speakers later my other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the newstand i ve tried magazines on here and they all look gorgeous now i can always have my magazines with me so if i m stuck at the airport or at the doctor s office i always have them one of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free i just had to connect my account to the device this allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as i ve had an account my other magazine didn t include a digital edition so i canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version it was an inexpensive magazine anyway there are several magazines that you can try free for days on the device i did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure the kindle fire doesn t come with the google play store installed you can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty you can google to find the instructions to do this it s not difficult to do if you re fairly comfortable with technology it probably took me minutes most of the apps i wanted were in the amazon store but there were a handful that i had paid for through google play the only way i could have them was to go back to access that store they have worked fine so far i despise the keyboard that amazon pre installed on this device there are no lines between the letters on the keyboard i suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys but i hate it i fixed that problem by going to google play and downloading a new keyboard it was a pretty easy problem to solve so i can t complain apps that are connecting to the internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets but that generally doesn t bother me if you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop however that might drive you crazy the screen on this device isn t bad if i compare it to my fancy phone it s not as shape but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone the screen is outstanding the speakers are ok there are two of them located on the bottom of the screen i won t say that they are fantastic they aren t in my opinion they are fine for watching youtube or a television show they are not ok for listening to music if you are an audiophile you can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre install app but still your music will sound tinny that being said you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker use a pair of headphones etc this device wasn t made for taking pictures it has a front and back camera but they aren t designed to be spectacular i m not using them i find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands i think that s partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick also i do have some hand problems similar to someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome i think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives i m still waiting for it i m greatly enjoying this device it s simply fun to use the tablet there are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use amazon services if you don t typically use amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the internet and you re looking for a low price tag this device may be ok for you,Positive

i already have amazon devices echo s and dot s i expected this device to be slightly different as it is the only amazon device i have with a screen i was pleasantly surprised at the large number of helpful features that a screen could bring it occasionally scrolls suggestions across the screen and most of them have been very helpful i m planning on setting another one up at my year old mothers house she ll get a kick out of it also,Positive

my family love alexa and so happy not having to buy any cd or another radio again,Positive
the ultimate bluetooth speaker i have multiple amazon echos and a whole echo system set up in my house i love everything amazon i can t stand apple but now i know how they feel i am a cult member of amazon lol so anyway i have been trashing this device the tap because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things i like most about the echo the only flaw of the echo is it is not portable i tried the triby but i did not like it more for little kids so on black friday the amazon tap was on super sale so i bought it the tap is smaller than i thought it was about rd the size of the echo which is perfect for portability but don t let the size fool you the sound is only short of bose when it comes to volume and sound quality important note you don t have to have an echo to use this device just the alexa app on your smart phone the tap does everything the echo does it is an amazing bluetooth speaker and it s portable automatically switches remembers different wifi areas and can be used with a hot spot the most amazing thing about the whole amazon echo system is that amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does some things even better than google now and light years ahead of siri the tap is my new favorite device it is perfect the only flaw is that it is not waterproof amazon if you are listening make the next tap waterproof,Positive
these things are cool with the new muti room music options i can have the same song playing in each room not to mention the intercom great item,Positive
small enough to carry every where when he is using it you can hear a pin drop,Positive

already had and when these when bb had a big sale price i couldn t order it fast enough i can see my nest cameras another product make video calls to other show owners voice calls to anyone else except and a whole host of skills that are being added almost daily my only regret is not replacing my remaining echo dots when they were on sale i won t make that mistake on next big sale i also received of the other home assistants included as free bonuses for buying a couple of other things i thought that it was only fair to compare the two disregarging the video aspects of show amazon s shows and dots echos were like comparing lambourgini to a vw bug setting up these things are like the expression i heard as a kid easier than fallin of a log and not near as dangerous,Positive
tablet works will with amazon video on our smart tvs as well as the firesticks,Positive

this is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device,Positive
i got the first version for my sister and she hasn t been able to put it down on over a year then i got her this one and forget about it great new features she loves loves loves it,Positive

the alexa show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that i had in the older device i m not sure if i m missing it in the show but i was able to get internet cameras on the older device such as san diego zoo elephants that you can t get on the show while certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch setup was pretty straight forward and easy it is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent it is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want such as play or start or open i use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then more or other combination you would have to set up several different alarms one for each day as far as i can see some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming i don t really want to be terrified awake each day i found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well it would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you d like i don t see that yet anywhere another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off if you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times i d rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe which is possible but very sensitive and if you miss here comes snooze just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly i am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so i can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time hoping that works well when it arrives it will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed all in all i d say it s a good emerging technology but needs a little work considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago it s kind of where we re heading,Positive
kinda bummed didn t realize i bought the package and didn t get my extra phillips hue bulb but i love the echo plus with the hub great product just annoyed that the sales guy at best buy didn t make sure i knew i also got a free bulb with my purchase,Positive

i purchase this tablet for my daughter s birthday and she absolutely loves it i am very pleased that she s not able to get online or to get on youtube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can t get into it i would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the google play store since it is an amazon tablet,Positive
the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale,Neutral
we returned it could not give answers to our questions even though the answers were easily found on google,Negative
i m not a techie but after days of trying to hook up i gave up i don t know if it was the echo plus or my carrier att uverse causing the issue but it would not connect so back to the store it went even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistance none of it worked,Neutral

i bought this for my mom she enjoys checking her email and facebook she enjoys playing games most of all,Positive
the amazon echo show is so much fun i got it for my husband for christmas and its absolutely more of a gift for myself we also got hue lights and have set it up our routines this show is so much fun we listen to the news in the morning while making coffee it wakes us up with slowly with the hue lights we listen to music while cooking dinner cant recommend it more because of this purchase i am also buying a spot we love the camera feature where you can drop in so we will continue buying these rather than the security cameras for the inside at least where we just want to say hello or see our dog,Positive

my year old daughter saved up to by this her brother bought the gb about a year earlier so new she needed more space the os is a bit clunky and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets but tough to beat the price speed isn t great for web or certain gaming apps but fine for books parental controls are helpful but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change overall ok first tablet for kids considering the price for adults fine for e books and very basic apps otherwise best to pay up for better quality and os efficiency,Neutral

i was a little hesitant to spend the money to get this but i am so glad i did alexa always answers when i say the commands and i have noticed it is probably right with any command that i have given love the fact that i can see things on the screen some of my news briefings have a picture video so that s nice too we also love the video call option planning on getting one for my grandma who is not as technologically advanced and could just sit at a table and talk with the grandkids worth every penny,Positive
alexa exceed expectations in it ability to control,Positive
great tablet for the grandkids they love it great item,Positive
for those that have prime this is almost a must have keeps all your amazon stuff in one place,Positive

good but setup to enable voice control only on ios is unclear,Positive
we are new to connected home equipment i got this for my wife in our kitchen the only thing i wish was different would be that the amazon show would communicate directly with facetime rather than having to have someone download the alexa app not a deal breaker by any means though we love it,Positive
i use it alot to play music instead of running the tv for my dog when we go somewhere i use it for a lot of things,Positive
easy to set up easy to use apps are awesome and sounds great,Positive
this is a great tablet for basic needs internet video streaming games books you dont need an ipad get one of these,Positive
i like this tablet it has everything you want however the apps within it need to be updated more often if this happened than it would be top above an ipad mini for now it gives me enough of what i need and in hd for it was a good deal,Positive
worked better than expected highly recommend the echo show,Positive
great sound quality easy to set up easy to use looks good too,Positive
this tablet is quick and as good as my ipad i use the tablet specifically for one aspect of my life and it performs great i am pleasantly surprised by its performance,Positive
amazon s echo show has been a great help to my daily rutine from asking simple things like the weather to more specific things like flash briefings or traffic to my commute echo show is a great tool for any tech enthusiast,Positive

it s a good tablet and comes with a lot of free apps and a fantastic warranty,Positive
i use it in my office as a personal assistant not just for the home,Positive
tech is not totally friendly but for the cost and what it does it is worth the investment,Positive
the tap is essentially a smaller version of the echo that has alexa capability like echo does but also doubles as a portable bluetooth speaker you do need to tap it to ask alexa to do anything but otherwise it works the same as echo i prefer the echo but the tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their echo,Positive
awesome product does what it says and looks great,Positive
i bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice it is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it it took over and set up things with amazon i did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with prime before i could figure out the settings the picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated,Positive
inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on step up from the nabi he was thrilled with it learn how to skype on it already,Positive
our rd amazon fire the battery life is outstanding really nice when reading a book not having to worry about the battery nice size,Positive
at first i wasnt sure if this was something i needed when i already have the echo but it was on sale for black friday so i thought why not as soon as it was set up i understood why i needed this it just enhances everything alexa does being able to see what she says is great seeing and adjusting my shopping list by touch is amazing i love walking in the room and seeing little news blurbs it looks sleek and beautiful on my counter i highly recommend this to anyone,Positive

it s at its heart an echo but having a screen on it with s of things to do with it make it a much easier recommendation over the simarly priced screenless echo plus,Positive
works well easy to use i like the auto on when you open the case,Positive
great entertainment when friends are over the knowledge and jokes are tons of fun,Positive
definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on black friday weekend,Positive
this little sorcerer s box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors,Positive
the kindle fire kid is easy enough that our year old can work it,Positive
if you use the alexa ecosystem then the show is a must,Positive
there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that i have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen this means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated,Neutral
the commercials are correct at this price you can have multiple devices in your household for the price of a comparable competitor s tablet,Positive
i have not set up tablet geeks squad to do so monday april,Positive

since i purchased mine the wife thought she would also like one so we picked up her one and she is using it a lot,Positive
my son washed it twice throw it a few times and it s still ticking,Positive
my home is about automated with help from alexa we want to have one in each room,Positive
its a great ereader but a little pricy it has the same specs as the voyage as far as pixels and procesor which costs less the only difference between this and the voyage is that it s much lighter it s brighter leds and a longer battery life if you re using the cover i ve noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover but you ll still be able to read for hours without it you would think it be water resistant hence the name but it isn t but then i don t plan on reading when it s raining or outside or while taking a bath overall it s the best ereader amazon currently has to offer but if you don t mind the price tag and want the best then go for it voyage is still not a bad option though,Positive
both love this tablet and the numerous educational apps available that i bought one for each,Positive
bought it for my yr old granddaughter does everything she wants it to do in a tablet,Positive

it s unfair for me to rate this product cause i have not even taken it out of the box to set it up,Neutral

worthless except as a regular echo and a poor excuse for video chat i love my echo devices bathroom pool kitchen other places where i may need hands free voice activated music and info my wife bought me the newest hottest thing i was skeptical but then thought i would use it to help on a project me alexa find videos on f drone alexa youtube is not available amazon won t directly sell chrome products youtube won t play on echo show further testing shows the video call is more limited than iphone or android apps for video so the most useful thing now is the same voice functions that my echos and dots perform unless i want to make all of my video calls and check the weather from a device i can move no more than feet from an outlet,Negative

i am reading positive reviews and wish i could say the same best buy is great so this is not a reflection on them just our experience with the product we have had this product for just over one month and i have had to contact amazon support perform factory resets to get content to show up and the device is poorly designed as the sd card pops out constantly which messes with drm and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the internet to fix it we are returning and spending the extra money for an ipad will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience if you just use the device for reading maybe this is for you but trying to download information to sd card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating as well as having to do factory resets so content owned already purchased on amazon would show up on the device in the library,Negative
i have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon i waited for minutes then i requested another code nothing then a nother one and still nothing i started to set up the device at am and by am i was fed up with it i had to step away after about hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about codes from amazon,Negative

was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one i could find especially because best buy was having a sale so with the fire a case a stylus and a microsd card i only spent a little over a i ve been using it just about every day since i got it in december and i ve not had any problems with it at all,Positive
its a great ereader but a little pricy it has the same specs as the voyage as far as pixels and procesor which costs less the only difference between this and the voyage is that it s much lighter it s brighter leds and a longer battery life if you re using the cover i ve noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover but you ll still be able to read for hours without it you would think it be water resistant hence the name but it isn t but then i don t plan on reading when it s raining or outside or while taking a bath overall it s the best ereader amazon currently has to offer but if you don t mind the price tag and want the best then go for it voyage is still not a bad option though,Positive
this is well constructed for kids my biggest reason i don t like it is it asks for a credit card for a kids tablet i suggest you buy a prepaid credit card or a amazon gift card for game purchases,Positive
great kid friendly product hours of enjoyment for all,Positive
we got this tablet for our toddler the setup was going great installed all the apps from amazon and transferred them to his account then we went to load netflix for him to say it s been frustrating with the netflix app is an understatement we had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice netflix does not work well with this tablet it either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all it takes several attempts to get netflix to load but then it works that s the only complaint other then that it s great,Positive
i talk myself into the g and i am so glad i did i have used only kindles for the past years and i love them i love the color as well,Positive

even when i m outside in bright sunlight the words of the book i m reading are still crystal clear that alone makes the kindle oasis worth what it cost me the kindle oasis wakes up in just seconds and any book i choose instantly opens ready to be read it is the perfect size and isn t heavy or bulky i really do read for hours at a time sometimes i pace the floor while i read sometimes i m on my elliptical machine when i read and sometimes i m sitting down no matter what i m doing the kindle oasis remains comfortable to hold and it is always easy on my eyes when i receive a book that is in pdf most of the time i can enlarge the words if it won t allow me to enlarge the words i can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger i am able to make notes on the book if needed and i can highlight words and or passages my merlot leather cover is attractive when i flip it open it is just like opening the cover of a book how to make the battery laston the kindle oasis page it says that its dual battery charging system delivers months of battery life this was a huge thing for me instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day i would be able to read for months without charging the kindle is this how my oasis has performed well not so much there are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your oasis to last for two months first you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day that one is impossible for me there are days that i am only able to read for thirty minutes but they don t occur very often my kindle goes everywhere with me and i use just about every spare moment to read second the wireless needs to be turned off that one is easy to do but not always easy to remember the only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books third this is based on your light setting at that is way too low for me i keep my light setting anywhere from to i don t limit my reading to thirty minutes a day and i try to remember to keep my wireless turned off my light setting is kept anywhere from to and i put my kindle to sleep the second i m done reading so how long does a single charge last me ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far but it would have kept a charge for several more days if i had remembered to turn my wireless off once i succeed in keeping my wireless off i will let you know how long the charge lasts now i don t plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low i allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover i allow it to drain down to about before i plug the cover and kindle into my computer to charge the one thing that surprised me was that everything on the oasis is in black and white for some reason i thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color but since i bought the oasis to read books on color isn t needed special offers do appear on my screen but only when my kindle is going to sleep or waking up they aren t a distraction and to be honest they are kind of fun to look at you can pay a higher price so they won t appear on your kindle if you would rather not see them i asked myself some questions once i had my kindle and knew just how it worked if i had known before i bought my kindle oasis that the charge wouldn t last for months would i still have bought it yes i would have if i had known that everything would appear in black and white would i still have bought it yes i would have,Positive

we got the kindle for our daughter who accompanied us to try out the two kindle models we were willing to buy either one and we assumed she would want the more expensive one with the backlighting feature but as she tried both she gravitated with certainty toward the basic model why would u want to read in the dark she said as the weeks and months have gone by she says she s completely happy with the basic kindle it s exactly what she wanted perfect,Positive

after purchasing different brand x charges at a lower cost and having both of them fail after a couple weeks of use i purchased this oem charger made by amazon for our kindle fire not only does it work well continuously but it fully charges the unit in a matter of hours instead of overnight charging being required still works great and well worth the few dollars extra in price,Positive

i bought this kindle for my yr old granddaughter for christmas me and my husband both had kindles several years prior and she and my year old grandson love watching and playing on them both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more my yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube videos and playing games on it he has several game systems xbox sega ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows i m getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good he would like one to call his own i m looking at a gb or gb they are really durable and tough,Positive
this was a excellent gift for the family a good choice,Positive
i bought four of these for my kids and they love them,Positive
i ordered this for my daughter as i have the black paperwhite and i love it i read quite a bit and the larger books were driving me crazy having to hold them up while laying down or wanting to take a book on vacation and lugging around a thick paperback with this i can throw it in my bag and read anywhere its light weight easy to use the battery life lasts for weeks which makes it an all around awesome device my daughter is in public school and they offer an online library for e readers so she can now download books for free from school you can also download your own public library app if your county offers that and read free from there as well you can shop for e books straight from the device through amazon com,Positive
i like this e reader but wish the screen were higher resolution it requires decent light to look good but it is easy on my eyes the screen updates involve flashing the whole screen which i noticed less over time the advertised month long battery life is just standby time it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books,Positive
can be dropped thrown and doesnt break awesome tablet,Positive
when i used to think of amazon echo i think flimsy sounds amazon echo was more of echo ing tin can complex at least from what i have experienced with my friends echos echo plus you ask not so much this device has such excellent sound one of the best devices i have ever purchased if i could i would have these all over my house forget the dot and the echo nd gen echo plus is the way to go beautiful device sounds is second to none,Positive
full disclosure i own five amazon echos including a few dots as well as this tap so obviously i m a fan of echoes honestly i couldn t figure out from amazons marketing and the online review how the tap fit in as compared to full blown echo and the dot i kept thinking it was limited compared to the echo and the dot because you had to tap the button to ask it question however given that it s completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command imo the tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the echo in a much smaller form factor since it s portable it s probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music my friends and i get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays michael bolton over my bruce springsteen bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown tap in a portable and smaller form very happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite,Positive
this is a great tablet there are thousands of books and movies and music to choose from the amazon store it is very easy to navigate,Positive
i truly enjoy this product i have an older one but this is superb in all areas of entertainment,Positive
this tablet is great for books audible books music and all things amazon the included browser silk is not the best i purchased expanded memory gb sd card for about more and a cover for about the biggest issue i have with this unit is that it is slow when compared to an ipad and it tends to freeze every so often for about x more money consider an ipad instead,Neutral
i bought this as a gift to my dad and he loves it well worth if you dont plan on reading in dark,Positive
i bought this as a christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it it hasn t been working as it should and its only been a little over months since she s had it i m going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps,Neutral
great tablet for the money so cheap that i use it for a stand alone interface for my fish tank,Positive
its great just needs expanding information on it,Positive
perfect for what i need to use it for movies etc great for a gift,Positive
i bought this for my brother and his wife they love it not only does it control their nest thermostat it works with their expanding environment of philips hue bulbs,Positive
overall the tablet is well constructed and well engineered the excited factor for my son wore off quickly including the included app services nothing negative to report but nothing unexpected in a positive sense either,Positive
if you are looking for an entry level tablet this is it the kindle fire hd is perfect for kids,Positive
amazon show is pretty cool it can help with things like cooking recipe homework and other things but it s restricted to only amazon partner things if google comes out with something similar i would have definitely chosen that over the show no youtube,Neutral
bought this as a gift for my daughter and it was a good buyshock proof and great educational apps for kids in it,Positive
with alexa in control you may need extra time to jog,Positive
i love hear readers i had to replace mine because i destroyed the last but it is awesome,Positive

easy and simple for my grandson to use has no problem using it,Positive
love this device performs perfectly plays music and lures lights off and on by command,Positive
love the new echo show picture is clear and the microphones pick up my voice from far away my wife likes it for recipes on the go and the show it is always thinking music sounds great coming from this small unit it was the talk of christmas,Positive
easy to use and navigate purchasing books is fast and simple and i love the fact that i can password protect this device,Positive
the first thing we noticed was alexa s response time to questions no waiting or downloading just lightning quick responses nd was the compatibility with our smart hone features she connects to our lights and security monitoring system with ease she is clear and concise,Positive
this is the best tablet for a kids tablet the modified android operating system with amazon features built in is great i am reviewing for what it is a kids tablet it has a gigahertz processor meaning for such a small device that decently enough internal memory is gigs but you can expand to gigabytes you wont run out of memory it has a megapixel camera that shoots in p meaning not full hd or k again if you bought it for a camera you d be wrong but for a kid years to years old that s good it has gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games our year old isn t playing any heavy graphics games that take up the cpu and gpu it came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job it has no resource hogging gps or radio but it does have bluetooth and wi fi,Positive
i needed a kindle for my schooling so i decided to look into this and read some reviews after reading the reviews i decided on this kindle and it is perfect compared to my other tablet,Positive
the amazon fire tablet is a great gift for kids of all ages ez and fun to use keeping kids entertained while giving them educational tools to use at their grade level and hire,Positive
my grandson loves his tablet we got him very safe,Positive
my dad uses this as a speaker for the tv and loves it he does use it in the traditional alexa way but the speaker option he discovered is an added benefit,Positive
replaced a kindle that crashed so fare everything is great larger screen fast response more storage don t have to charge as often well pleased,Positive
i was hoping to use google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen still cheap and fine for watching movies,Neutral
i have two dots and this and the functionality between them is awesome i can t wait to see how it improves through time great quality speaker and build,Positive
meh it works i find it difficult to navigate i also have an ipad mini this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad,Neutral
my granddaughter loves it it was a perfect gift for her long airplane trip,Positive

my father upgraded from the original kindle fire to this model and he s very happy with it it doesn t compete with more mainstream tablets but he likes the kindle s system for downloading library books,Neutral
i am loving my amazon echo show it makes life easier i love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking alexa i also love being able to video call friends and family that have an echo show or the alexa app overall it is a great product,Positive
this is my second kindle and i love it it s lightweight simple and fast it s convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down,Positive

use it in bathroom to listen to my amazon music and with alexa you can control it with just your voice,Positive
still learning new things about my tablet very easy to use perfect size,Positive
i like being able to turn on lights music and the thermostat in our home,Positive
alexa show is really well put together the main reason for my purchase was to create my own surveillance system linking my ring doorbell and ring floodlights to view on command by alexa on the show screen yes you can talk to it and get results for almost any query but with the show you get a lot more the touch screen is great for video calls especially when you install the alexa app on your family cell phones alexa can scan items via upc and order them on amazon or tell you where to get them the recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you but shown to you also when music plays you can see the lyrics on screen if you use amazon music to play the music you can ask for a news briefing and you see the news highlights etc the speakers aren t quite up to the same standard as the echo series but it s close the sound fills the room nicely when the echo show is not being immediately used the screen shows a picture of your choice making it a digital frame too overall the device is very nice and they are constantly releasing new skills for alexa to use so it seems like there is always something new to wow you turning on and off lights adjusting your thermostat playing music viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties there is way more to do with this device,Positive
bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them very useful,Positive
this tablet is great for kids and adults who have little to no knowledge of computers it handles easily and has plenty of storage,Positive
this is great tablet its great for people who don t need a lot of apts or store a lot on it doesn t over heat light weight,Positive
i bought this as an affordable alternative to the ipad mini i liked the expandable storage option and size super easy to use unfortunately granddaughter wanted and ipad mini to go with her other apple products so i ended up returning it in hindsight i should ve kept it for myself,Positive
this is a great addition to the other alexa products by amazon it works great in the kitchen better voice recognition and sound the onscreen display and information are very helpful the video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working cooking it can also scroll personal photos as a picture display all in all echo show is a wonderful addition well worth it especially if you get it on sale,Positive

i have had every version of the kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a kindle fire i replaced the first one i had in and it was everything i wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat so i got this one first of all i miss swype why get rid of it secondly i cannot put two of my favorite apps which work on my old one to work on this but lastly and most importantly every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code shimmering in the background and only turning it off and or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life and it turns itself off it seems to happen when i close a program and move to a new one aggravating and not what i expect from a product with which i have been happy in the past,Neutral
very cool it fully incorporates all of my smart home products,Positive
awesome and repeat times that should do it blah,Positive
it is amaizin i like the way you type and search my favorites,Positive

my yr old daughter got this tablet from santa for christmas so far she loves it a little too much perhaps i only use it to manage her account permissions and so far haven t had any issues with it software and hw not quite as refined as apple ipad products but what can you expect at the lower price point,Positive
good tablet for my daughter she loves it but she gets annoyed how the battery runs out quickly,Positive
purchased this as a child s tablet and i couldn t be happier i was buying it thinking that it would be cut rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days despite the low cost and unimpressive stats i have been very surprised by the quality the screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows the parental controls child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers crush the built in speakers on my ipad air the only drawbacks i have found so far are power related the battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what i would consider normal use and the included charger typical usb type takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet i suspect this is the charger s limitation rather than the tablet s and it may charge better with a different power supply i wish that i had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and i would have kept the second for my own use when on the road,Positive
the features that i found on the fire tablet far exceeded my expectations well worth the purchase price,Positive
i was looking for a tablet for my year old this tablet was definitely worth the price and it s not a kiddie tablet as she calls them,Positive
my son has the hd fire used for last years i bought this one for my moms birthday she loves it it s easy to navigate and the ability to increase the size of the print allows for the smaller screen cheaper price,Positive
i bought this for my year old son for christmas he loves it,Positive
this is a must have is great for recepies while you are cooking alexa gives you the info for the ines that are used to a tablet or ipod that you have to stop and read this is awesome plus so much easier to follow things,Positive

my first tablet outstanding for netflix email etc,Positive
i love all of the things you can do with the echo i am still learning everything i can do and look forward to more content going forward,Positive
bought as birthday present for grandson and he plays with it daily and with the case on it he hasn t broken it either,Positive

my yr old daughter loves it perfect xmas gift,Positive
bought it for my grandson for christmas and he loves it,Positive
smaller overall size with the same screen size of our older kindle fire faster processor,Positive
it a great product the quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear,Positive
i love this solutions for my kids i gave it a four star rating because in order to install apps you just have to tap the icon well my two year old and five year old went tap crazy like a kangaroo on a pogo stick needless to say the ran out of room quickly i tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren t installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn t aside from this it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with i especially like the parental control features i just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed,Positive
young kids love it easy to use and takes a beating but still cheap enough that if it does happen to break you don t break the bank too,Positive
awesome sound which was unexpected it s nice seeing info on the screen such as recipes song lyrics weather etc,Positive
really enjoy having the echo to use to control the lights and music in our house,Positive
we use echo almost every day it is fun to ask questions the music is great we check the weather and listen to nprnews,Positive
the amazon fire was a gift for my mom and she seems to really enjoy it i have one so i bought her this one for her birthday she enjoying all the games she downloaded,Positive
works great very responsive and quick i love tying the whole house together with this and the echoes,Positive
amazon has consistently delivered quality tablets at the best prices and this is no exception,Positive
nice starter tablet for my nephew does what we need it to do,Positive
worked fine first time out of the box plug it in set it up with you amazon account and you are ready to go it is very convenient to turn on and off the phillips light by voice,Positive
this fire tablet has long battery life reasonable fast,Positive
the unit does a good job of playing music from amazon music it hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when i tell it to turn on a particular lamp and i have to slowly pronunciate it like that the music shows the lyrics do need a family account on amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though,Positive
great product easy to set up and use my child loves it,Positive
best money i ever spent for my grand child she just love it,Positive
i live the echo show so easy to set up and use i have one in the kitchen and one in our main bathroom,Positive

purchased this for my grandson it works great however if i were to do it over again i would spend the extra to get the one without the ads they drive you crazy the ads make the cheaper unit really frustrating,Positive
i love my kindle it makes it so much easier to read books instead of having to carry them with me,Positive
works great for my daughter great price and apps,Positive
good inexpensive device still in touch with modern technology,Positive
i wondered about buying one before making the decision now even after just a few weeks i wonder how i managed it has some gimmicky things yes but also can help out with a lot of very useful ideas such as weather traffic and lists would recommend one to anyone,Positive
i really like it it s user friendly and i was by coolidge from apple family to the family,Positive
another great echo product really cool feature is the lyrics scrolling across the screen when playing music,Positive
despite a less than friendly price point if you don t get it on sale this amazon item is well designed and delivers on the promises in the hype and product description the emphasis with this item is show so it s no surprise that sound quality does not compare with the echo but if you want the convenience of a voice controlled screen other than your phone this product delivers it s value is even greater when paired with other smart devices such as security cams another added bonus comes when friends or family also have a show so that you can do drop in which is essentially visual phone calls it s great for checking on elderly family because it does not require them to be technically savvy,Positive
grandson is enjoying the new games on it it s much bigger than his ipod,Positive
this game seems to be another good addition to the pokemon craze my son got this for christmas and has played it often since he says that it s awesome which is high praise indeed,Positive
this was an xmas gift for my wife she had wanted a pad of some sort but i just couldn t afford an ipad so i looked at the fire as an alternative first the screen size was just what i wanted second the price was very reasonable third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife s skills and needs she absolutely loves it and i actually got a compliment on my present giving that don t happen very often let me tell you i will recommend this she s pleased i m pleased what else do you need my son was able to piggyback off of this gift and purchased her the cover to go with it so it really worked for my family and i made my wife happy,Positive
i like this kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older amazon kindle fire,Positive
purchased the echo show for my wife and she loves it full of great information weather and more can control lights and various things at the house even askes you the question of the day easy set up and to use mainly bought it to monitor the arlo pro cameras we purchased,Positive
my child loves her tablet and i love it it keeps her busy with learning games and books,Positive
this tablet is so great for school children to play and learn on,Positive
i own multiple echoes and i like the show the best the screen adds a lot of value in my opinion i really like being able to see upcoming calendar events and daily news my kids like watching cartoons from amazon prime while eating breakfast the speakers are great and put out more than enough quality sound for their size at it was a great deal,Positive
was very difficult to set up with the hours help of geek squad and my granddaughters i phone we got it done,Positive
quite an upgrade from the original fire the deletion of the carousel was a welcome change the new turn style approach is faster and more consice still don t know why a chime sounds also miss the ease of making notes while reading there has got to be a better way to organize books trying to figure out series trilogies etc is impossible and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that amazon won t pick up a new purchase as a book already read,Positive
i love the the kindles bought this for my grandson impressed with the years no questions asked warranty,Positive
i like this product but have problems with it turning itself on when just charging it also several times it shut down and i had to go to reinstall factory settings losing my stuff alot of new options i do not use but several of my friends like,Positive

my first tablet was a kindle i was curious about the updated version very disappointed,Negative
my year old granddaughter carries her tablet everywhere she loves it,Positive
echo plus has everything the old echo had plus better sound and built in capability for smart home add ons like hue bulbs and smartthings plugs without needing a hue hub or st hub love it,Positive
making a gift baskey and choose to place this kindle fire as the main surprise great price,Positive
there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that i have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen this means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated,Neutral
i love all my alexa s i have the echo and now for christmas i got the echo show not i can see my recipes and also connect with my family,Positive
reasonably priced and worth every penny i love it,Positive
wanted one that played bejeweled blitz this one does not,Positive

i purchased this tablet for a yr old and it is very easy for him to use,Positive
very happy with the hd fire gb plenty of memory and easy to navigate i would definitely recommend this item,Positive
the amazon fire hd is a great buy very inexpensive but delivers great quality give a rating and not because there are advertisements on lock screen some may welcome the ads others not overall this tablet is great battery life is several days with very minimal usage battery lasts to hours with average usage including video,Positive

got for my aunt for her first tablet it has been user friendly for her she yours it mostly for reading,Positive
my son loves it easy to use and download books requested for his birthday gift,Positive

im happy to have it very comfortable and easy to use every where,Positive
the three star review is for the situation described here not the quality of the unit i ordered this online and picked it up in store the package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory the echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package when i hooked it up however it said that the unit was registered to someone else it wasn t a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine i spoke to both amazon and target about this and neither could tell me what happened i was offered an exchange if i wished i chose to keep the original unit but i wanted to make others aware of the issue i have one theory target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for target resale and they are all registered to this person i guess i ll never know the echo itself works fine and i m very happy with it after you hook it up make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates then you should be good to go,Neutral
i bought of these to use in a school education program the workers at best buy assured me the apps i needed them to run would work fine unfortunately i was not aware that amazon has it s own app store unrelated to apple and goggleplay make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the amazone app store as not all are specifically they block anything related to goggle other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case,Positive
bought this for my grandson along with a case for his birthday he loves it and all the apps available for a kid his age,Positive

as above a high class e reader love it use it at least hrs daily,Positive
looking at the picture and seeing it was th generation i assumed it would be a great device i had an original kindle but i stopped using it because it wasn t backlit i thought an th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not after minutes on the phone with amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that th generation is not supported with backlights i took it back to target and purchased the paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it the th generation one is smaller so i assumed that was the reason for the price difference target made the experience pleasant,Negative
great device for music and face time calls the sound is crisp and clear many options with the echo show,Positive

it is difficult to understand the instructions i am still working on it,Neutral
great christmas gift the hubby loved it just read the manual before setting up,Positive
great for games and reading price was great great battery life well worth the money,Positive
here are my pros and cons thus far pro perfect size for ebooks and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketchild accounts amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil johnny can play clash of clans and how much he can hit the ol visa card for battery life thus far wife was on it for about hours last night and battery was at about kindle integration this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my kindle books look great,Positive
i brought this tablet during the black friday sale fast forward to christmas when my year opens it he was happy i set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on blank screen he was disappointed and so was i,Negative
i really like that my child is engaged with all of the different apps we have downloaded,Positive

great tablet for under does not have the highest specs but gets the job done for lite tablet users,Positive
bought this tablet for my son great battery life shipped fast great value,Positive
i am so delighted i purchased this tablet for my toddler son pros the rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating which was crucial for this purchase another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign on which works like any other tablet from the adult sign on you can customize what your kids can watch screen time allowance and add or remove apps for them the price isn t bad compared to the price of adult tabletscons kind of bummed i can t link my google play apps i purchased but i guess it makes sense this is not a google android product the battery life isn t all that great but the charger is fast i wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching netflix or other videos highly recommend for anyone with young children you won t be disappointed,Positive
great product easier set up than anticipated actually bought for my mother she loves it,Positive

i resisted getting this since i already have two echo units and one dot black friday gave me reason to buy one i love it twice as much as the regular echo the set up is faster and easier and i love the visuals i use my shopping list and to do list a lot and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it i may be getting another,Positive

this was a present for my husband who originally had asked for a radio for his home office he set it up relatively quick and was amazed at the sound quality he loved the versatility and that he could have a specific radio station played or a random song as well as tell a joke etc it has been fun for all of us and we are looking into getting the smaller dots for other rooms now he commented that he would never get rid of this it s very fun and functional the smart bulb is very handy as well love it,Positive
my nephews love to play with my phone now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands however if its a rare case where they don t they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum the kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained and best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate murphy s law in action,Positive

the last models of kindle hdx have been terrible we have purchased of each model of kindle and up until the last models they have been great last years had to be replaced or times and for the same problem the slot for the sd card is defective i gave up and bought the newest model it shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason it s going back after the first of the year this is going to be my last year for kindles unless they make them the same quality as before phooey,Negative
while the fire hd tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units for basic web surfing email and especially shopping on amazons web site this tablet performs well although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites the screen resolution is what i would call adequate but not on par with other high resolution and far more expensive tablets out there overall i am pleased with this tablet so far,Positive

i am pleasantly surprised at how well this works i bought the e reader and it didn t work so i was nervous buying this kindle but it works great and my son loves it,Positive
this is a great way to begin making your home a smart home easy to set up built in hub easy to use,Positive
alexa rocks the echo plus is super easy to set up i works great love everything about it adding more devices,Positive
i bought this as a cheap alternative to an old slow ipad until i could spring for the ipad pro got it as a black friday deal so it was more than worth it was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than i thought it could be and having amazon prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device i carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it s value can t beat it for the price,Positive
my fiance really enjoyes it i would definitely recommend,Positive
i own an echo and the tap the tap is slower to respond if you haven t used the echo then you will like the tap,Neutral

i love this tablet one of the best out there on the market,Positive
worse graphics won t keep a wireless connection overall not satisfied,Neutral
very satisfied with product as do my family kids,Positive
i ve had lots of tablets in the past mostly from the samsung line but this is my first amazon fire so i want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these at the time that this was written alexa had not been added to the tablet first while this device runs an android type of operating system amazon puts its own spin on the operating system i don t feel like i m using android this feels different to me it doesn t have the same level of customization that android users have come to appreciate that being said if you are an amazon prime member this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine it s simply a fun way to consume your magazines books etc there are on screen buttons on the bottom of the device the middle button immediately takes you to your home screen the button to the left acts as a sort of back button it also lets me get rid of my keyboard when i don t need it on screen but it s open the button to the right is super important it took me a couple of days to realize what it does that square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open it lets you switch between apps but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out you can close them by pressing the x button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right if you leave all of those apps open and you never close them you ll drain your battery make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps the device has several menus that you swipe left to view first you start with your home screen you literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet all of your apps are housed here you swipe up to view all of them the tablet comes with several apps pre installed such as slik amazon s own internet browser audible good reads the amazon app store a weather app etc you can go to the amazon app store to download other apps such as twitter facebook etc you can combine the apps on this page into folders you just drag one app to another app and a folder appears this made my home screen much more manageable you can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings this feature doesn t necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps however i believe it only changes the font on your main screens if you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device when you have a new issues it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of new items the device comes with a free month subscription to the washington post you ll see that under new items when you initially activate your tablet you can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos you can do this through the settings menu on the device if you want to use one of your own photos however you need to either take it on the device or move it into amazon s photos app which is a cloud based app so far i haven t found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper i m not crazy about the amazon photo app i found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into amazon s cloud just so i could view them on my tablet that being said i m not planning to take photos on this device i just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper beyond the home screen you can swipe to the right to view your other screen they are pre arranged to be books videos games shop apps music audiobooks and newstand all of those screens are connected to your amazon account for example if you have kindle books you ve already purchased they automatically will appear under the books menu your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu there doesn t seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages that bugs me but it s not the end of the world there s also one menu to the left of the home menu it s the recent page it shows you what you ve received looked at on the tablet i never use it but it might be handy for some people one of my favorite features of this tablet is amazon s on deck capability if you re an amazon prime member amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like the items don t count against your pre installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full you can turn off the on deck feature if you don t like it i ve been content with the video playback capability this isn t my major use of the device but the images look fine and the audio is ok i ll talk more about the speakers later my other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the newstand i ve tried magazines on here and they all look gorgeous now i can always have my magazines with me so if i m stuck at the airport or at the doctor s office i always have them one of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free i just had to connect my account to the device this allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as i ve had an account my other magazine didn t include a digital edition so i canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version it was an inexpensive magazine anyway there are several magazines that you can try free for days on the device i did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure the kindle fire doesn t come with the google play store installed you can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty you can google to find the instructions to do this it s not difficult to do if you re fairly comfortable with technology it probably took me minutes most of the apps i wanted were in the amazon store but there were a handful that i had paid for through google play the only way i could have them was to go back to access that store they have worked fine so far i despise the keyboard that amazon pre installed on this device there are no lines between the letters on the keyboard i suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys but i hate it i fixed that problem by going to google play and downloading a new keyboard it was a pretty easy problem to solve so i can t complain apps that are connecting to the internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets but that generally doesn t bother me if you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop however that might drive you crazy the screen on this device isn t bad if i compare it to my fancy phone it s not as shape but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone the screen is outstanding the speakers are ok there are two of them located on the bottom of the screen i won t say that they are fantastic they aren t in my opinion they are fine for watching youtube or a television show they are not ok for listening to music if you are an audiophile you can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre install app but still your music will sound tinny that being said you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker use a pair of headphones etc this device wasn t made for taking pictures it has a front and back camera but they aren t designed to be spectacular i m not using them i find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands i think that s partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick also i do have some hand problems similar to someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome i think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives i m still waiting for it i m greatly enjoying this device it s simply fun to use the tablet there are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use amazon services if you don t typically use amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the internet and you re looking for a low price tag this device may be ok for you,Positive

less than useless does not work with amazon cloudcam i purchased this from best buy to allow me to monitor my two cloud cams from my kitchen i am very tech savvy and have numerous alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work i tried installing and enabling the amazon cloudcam skill made sure there were no new updates for the show the show automatically updated when i first plugged it in the final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can t use the show with the cloudcam and then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem useless is no help less than useless actually makes more work the echo show is less than useless,Negative

i am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd the picture is awesome even for a movie i use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice i have a inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile plus there was a great black friday price,Positive

definitely easy on the eyes for long reading sessions especially when compared to the lcd screens of smart phones and tablets the only issues we had were that it drops the connection to our wifi network and then won t connect to the kindle store i don t think it s an issue with my network since all our other devices don t have the connectivity issues we had with this,Positive

the amazon fire os is not a perfect os but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use i would recommend checking the amazon store to ensure the apps you are thinking of using on a fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues the size on this one is good the screen is not the brightest hd screen that is available but at this price point i cannot complain,Positive

the kindle is great it s easy to set up and i ve found all the books that i wanted,Positive
alexa may be new but i would have thought some of the simple commands she would have been able to respond to already for the amount amazon charges it should come with better instructions including what specifically to download into one s device iphone etc so as to make some apps ready to go amazon dropped the ball on this one,Neutral
great for kids simple and inexpensive g must better than g,Positive

enjoying my tap asking alexa questions and the small form factor makes it easy to take along while traveling decent battery life and sound for such a small speaker only reason i didn t give stars was the difficulty in connecting the tap to public wifi s such as hotels in my situation takes some effort,Positive
bought this mostly as a backup and to read a few books since i have a larger cell phone and a back up used it occasionally may or hours of use till this week when i sent my laptop in for repairs so i probably used it a tot this week i was watching my rd primetime video this week and it simply turned off it will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode it is gone it is toast bought it october it quit on february my old fire lasted or years with more use it had stereo speakers lasted a week on a charge not or days sturdier built this is full of junk i am not just offered more apps it is constantly trying to add them junk junk junk,Negative
i bought this tab as a birthday gift for my yr old nephew who lives in india it s very useful for him to google for important information over the internet for his school assignments also he can video chat with me using skype rightly priced to be a kid s product resolution could ve been better if its targeted as a kid s product i think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text,Positive

the reviews on this on amazon seemed awesome little did i know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets we just bought this for christmas and went to charge it for the first time nothing we already loaded and paid for several apps and now we re out that money also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before there s some wear at the edge of it so i went online to see if i could find this issue and there it is everywhere this is a problem that has been around for years but android who is the ultimate culprit has failed to fix it at the source when you plug in the charger there s no click so you know it s in place it just slides in and out we ve had apple products for several years and never had an issue then the first droid product we purchase can t even be charged from the beginning this will be going back to bestbuy and will buy another ipad mini costs more but is much much more reliable,Negative
seriously a flawless portable smart multipurpose gadget add this to the incredible flash sale price and i d have been a fool to pass it up fast charge balanced tuning easy to pair and did i mention highly portable the cradle is a sweet design too the only beef i have is that your bluetooth is paired screaming at you when syncing own one of these,Positive
it needs the internet to connect to your devices and play music sometimes you can be cut off the rest of the time it is easy as can be,Positive
grandson used a borrowed one at school so now has his own,Positive
my year old daughter saved up to by this her brother bought the gb about a year earlier so new she needed more space the os is a bit clunky and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets but tough to beat the price speed isn t great for web or certain gaming apps but fine for books parental controls are helpful but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change overall ok first tablet for kids considering the price for adults fine for e books and very basic apps otherwise best to pay up for better quality and os efficiency,Neutral

bought the echo show because of the display and am not disappointed the echo was purchased for somebody as a gift but this was purchased for me and is working great the only thing that i am disappointed with is that i have to go through bluetooth to play my music which is on itunes the display is also very vivid and clear,Positive
kids love their kindles amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content they love the games apps and videos available to them based on their age the only reason i give this stars is due to the charging connectors they are not kid friendly and the kids bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their devices on their own otherwise kindle kids is amazing,Positive

i bought of these tablets for my two youngest children they had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go but they were already familiar with the ipad since they stole mine all the time lol that made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first besides that it s a good product,Neutral

i love everything about it it is portable sounds better than most portable speakers and alexa rocks it only thing that kept it from a star rating is that you have to manually activate alexa wish it would work like the echo and dot while it is on its base,Positive
i ve purchased of these for my kids the last few years while they are playing a tablet or two i keep the other tablets charged i ve enjoyed using them myself,Positive
it was a perfect gift for my godson he loved it definitely would recommend this product,Positive
built in hub only lets your control philips hue with your voice you still need the philips hue hub to be able to use the hue app i ended up buying the hue hub as well has better speaker than the regular echo,Positive
bought this mostly as a backup and to read a few books since i have a larger cell phone and a back up used it occasionally may or hours of use till this week when i sent my laptop in for repairs so i probably used it a tot this week i was watching my rd primetime video this week and it simply turned off it will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode it is gone it is toast bought it october it quit on february my old fire lasted or years with more use it had stereo speakers lasted a week on a charge not or days sturdier built this is full of junk i am not just offered more apps it is constantly trying to add them junk junk junk,Negative

you get what you pay for playtime works when it wants to went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time my son is almost he gets bored of it quickly the pros are the price and it is well protected externally,Neutral
i love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can t get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which i don t because i have a four and year old there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups,Positive

making our home smart and adding echo has been great so convenient,Positive
very fun to have music at the ready with a voice command we use it with amazon unlimited which has nearly everything good to view recipes with allrecipes so we keep it in the kitchen for reference and musical ambience the video is good too it has youtube functionality it would be nice to have regular tv though but that is probably on the providers for now nice to have the photo background and lastly to have lyrics on the screen when music is played,Positive
i love to read but don t have the space to keep a collection of books for me this kindle is the best of both worlds i can enjoy reading a good book without having to find shelf space to store it later,Positive
i was a bit reluctant to jump on the alexa wagon but now that i have i don t know why this is awesome still figuring out all the things i can do but only because there are so many,Positive
the protective rubber guard works so well easy parental controls,Positive
i especially like the amazon has a system to convert pdf to kindle format some of the things i read journal articles are in pdf format and i can email them to my kindle email and it shows up on my kindle with kindle format larger text you can find your kindel email at your account information only thing i would have like a screen little larger,Positive
great little device easy to connect to bluetoothdecent sound,Positive
for a basic tablet this is perfect good price does all i need it to,Positive
it was bought as a christmas gift so therefore no review,Positive
good to use it to read books under light the price is lower than other website,Positive
the sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product that s compatible with my mother s arlo security cameras it works great,Positive
i truly love this item its amszing good will do,Positive
i haven t used any other kindle before but this kindle was made to do its job and it does it properly it is sleek lightweight and sturdy i love putting it in my bag and taking it with me wherever i go just in case i get a chance to read like it says in the description you can download books and read it anywhere you don t need wifi to read battery life is great it has a matted screen and you can make the font as big or as small as you want the down side is that the screen is small so you can only get through so much before you have to flip the screen also there is no brightness controller for the screen so you can only read it where it s light but i honestly love my kindle it does it s job and i don t want anything that get s fancier than this,Positive
this product is so very convenient i have day i don t want to get up and she helps me,Positive
my kids love their amazon kindles they can take them anywhere and play on them great battery life,Positive
like the idea of having a built in hub to control other smart home devices as we get them sound quality is marginally better but we didn t buy echos as audiophiles but for background music and it s perfect for that my only complaint to date is that we have to accounts in our home and amazon echo must have one or the other that makes it frustrating for the other user particularly when playing configuring music to play in all rooms,Positive
perfect for educational games the protective case sold me,Positive
great product and it is very easy to set up and use,Positive
good picture and sound quality handy size meets my needs and then some,Positive
we love it the whole family likes to ask questions,Positive
excellent reader and product for the price very easy to use,Positive
bought this tablet for my son great battery life shipped fast great value,Positive
bought this fire for my wife to replace one which got accidently broken great,Positive
it s not bad for the novelty of alexa might as well get the echo sound it not bad and i m no audiophile might be good when my echo dots come in is it worth it there are better bluetooth speakers out there,Positive
alexa really amazes me she learns new skills everyday,Positive
yes it s a little glitchy sometimes but so useful and fun i m hoping that over time amazon will continue to improve on the errors in alexa when contacting customer service it doesn t seem like amazon is very interested in learning the problems that need fixing though,Positive
i purchased this so my daughter could read her online books perfect size,Positive
i got it for my kid and she loves it the amazon free time and prime well worth the money,Positive
the show works great with my other products love it,Positive
i originally purchased this to use as a bluetooth speaker for my wife s music but soon realized that we would use this much more than we thought ya turning on and off lights is good and being able to dim with the included bulb is pretty great but there are hundreds of smart home type of apps that work with this including my sony google tv and more show up regularly makes it almost too easy to be lazy,Positive
alexa on the go works as bluetooth speaker with your comparable phone,Positive
bought for my daughter instead of an i pad works well love the amazon underground app store but battery life doesn t seem to last as long as older i pads easy enough though for a child to use,Positive
was super easy to connect via bluetooth great sound fun to use,Positive
well i bought this on a lark and to my surprise i m using it all day long to get the news alerts check the weather and listen to music works well and even understands my relatively heavy southern accent,Positive
i have several around the house and love playing music on them,Positive
kind of hard adding smart items but when you do it s nice to just talk and not get on computer or smart phone to control,Positive
i bought this as a gift for my husband and he is constantly asking alexa questions about everything we love listening to music on it as well,Positive
the sleek design and colors available for small kids is good the tablet is a nice price and useful,Neutral
we bought the amazon echo show for my dad we set up accounts for him to access music and pictures and wrote down a sample list of commands he could use he loves it excellent product no end to the features you can set up,Positive
this thing is cool you can do a lot of neat things with the show hope they add more functionality to alexa though,Positive
love the case table works very well easy to download game and apps but the life of the battery is not great the battery fully charged only last about hours,Positive
we are used to ipads in our house this has taken some learning to get used to a slightly different format but it works great the price point is perfect for kids to use without the worry,Positive
bought this for my year old grandson and he loves it good learning tool along with great fun for him,Positive
i purchased this as a gift for my grandfather he was excited when he opened it and will get great use out of it while he is in doors for winter,Positive
i really like this product my son got us the alexa show for christmas and i wanted one that would turn on lights and other items so we purchased this because it has the bridge so that you can use it with the phillips hue lights it works great i have the show in the kitchen and i have the echo in my bedroom i love that it has a great built in speaker i can have it play my music in both rooms at the same time,Positive
my other one last for two years than went out my daughter loves it,Positive
at the price it is almost an impulse buy i wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies read etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy if you are used to an ipad the fire hd is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less it fit my needs but i felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct if you go in with the understanding this isn t an ipad replacement this should fit the bills for you let s just say after my trip i purchased an ipad pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children if you have amazon prime you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item,Positive
perfect technology for my year old son for games reading and homework,Positive
i added this to my echo collection great for on the go and around the house i don t like that you have to tap it to activate,Positive
picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage love that it s battery powered never had an issue of it running out of juice the only issue i have is with the mics it doesn t respond to your voice as well as the echo or dot then again it wasn t really designed to listen for the alexa command since it originally required you to tap the speaker to get it to listen,Positive
this is a great personal speaker i have both the tap and the echo the only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically tap the mic button to activate alexa the sound quality is pretty good for the price if you can afford it i would upgrade to the echo,Positive
i am enjoying my kindle very much easy to down load books and easy to read very happy with my purchase,Positive
nice and compact great sound easy to use love it,Positive
i didn t do any in depth research on this particular tablet the price and speed were good for what i wanted it for my only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so i can see my personal home screen picture,Neutral

we are enjoying our amazon echo show alexa is so amazing answering questions and a variety of music,Positive
kindle is the perfect e reader easy to use and size is perfect to bring book on the go,Positive
excellent just as good as ipad with a fraction of the price,Positive
the echo show is hands down the best device of the echo lineup i ve bought at least one of everyone except the tap i use this to call and check on my grandparents who i got one for christmas it s amazing watching my arlo and ring cameras on the screen also watching news segments and looking at cooking recipes videos is great it s also the easiest to set up of the echo devices you don t even need to use the app,Positive
gets use everyday by my girlfriend who i bought it for with no complaints also love the color also may get one for myself,Positive
great tablet very clear picture would buy again,Positive
great sound and function alexa the color and style of the silver plus looks great with our newly finished basement,Positive
i ve always been a reader and an early technology adopter but until now i ve resisted moving to electronic media when reading for pleasure now i wish i hadn t waited so long reading at night with the lights off and instantly downloading a new book are my favorite aspects,Positive
i bought this on a whim because my brother recommended i try it sometimes hard to believe how important this is in my life this has opened up my long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime,Positive
bought for my year old mom she loves it help her with recipes and cooking,Positive
small light but comfortable to hold with either hand if you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting the battery last for weeks lovin it so far,Positive

i purchased this tablet for my year old and he loves it very easy to use and setup,Positive

alexa is awesome to have at home makes things fun and easy,Positive
product is good light amazing battery backup i charge the kindle one in weeks great product for reasonable price usb connection is easy books are easy to download overall everyone must have kindle with them and this is the best product model to start with understandably this is the beginner level model for people who never used kindle before features like led lights white paper background are not available on this model these features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in dark without lights but again for this price you would not get any other good readers if you are someone who reads in dark then i would suggest go for higher kindle models,Positive
my son just love playing games on this tablet its easy and fun,Positive
the table is great just to experience what is available on a tablet without a hugh expense i would recommend to others,Positive
this was a great purchase i love my echo plus with the hue light bulb the set up is really easy and you can hook up your amazon account and order from alexa you can program your lights to be turned on at a certain time every day or even download the app and turn them on remotely i love how this product is compatible with nest products,Positive

ok i was so unsure of this kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others but i am very happy with it i love my kindle i have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce i got if for christmas i have been reading the free books on kindle there are so many to pick from while home i download the books that i want to read and then while i am in the car or waiting at the dmv i just pull of the book and read it remembers where i am in the book this kindle does not have the back light i was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me when i am reading in the car i enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me that is the most important factor for me because i can get car sick if i read while riding in the car but with the larger font i don t have that problem i wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because i can hold it up if i need to the size is perfect again i can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability love it,Positive

quite an upgrade from the original fire the deletion of the carousel was a welcome change the new turn style approach is faster and more consice still don t know why a chime sounds also miss the ease of making notes while reading there has got to be a better way to organize books trying to figure out series trilogies etc is impossible and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that amazon won t pick up a new purchase as a book already read,Positive

if you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather markets and the latest news the amazon echo show is what you are looking for honestly the product is top of the line technology and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it and read the directions the size of it is truly perfect it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand and with that it truly can serve that purpose it also has a touch screen and i feel it is very durable and can stand to last the sound quality is also superb with dual inch speakers it has bluetooth capabilities as well but it only works with android samsung fire os ios device excluding mac products the echo show comes in two colors black and white the product has many different features and functions and they can accommodate pretty much anyone s needs the top feature is the alexa app which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything then i believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want also you can tell it to volume up or down as well another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command smart home options a couple things that could be improved is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words and it will search for something you aren t expecting the other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices so then you don t have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly the price is also fair as well for its creative capabilities it has so if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the echo show would be a great addition for you,Positive

i had reservations for the purchase of this echo show they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since christmas day everyone in my family loves the camera function sound quality picture resolution and basically everything about it it isn t totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for amazon and their customers versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music pictures videos to having your favorite book read to you one of my favorite features are the ole time radio series offered in the skills takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added although we have several echo dots everywhere my yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud the sound is amazing for its size that s a huge plus pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it s shape slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for i have it connected to our home security system robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone taken all together it is useful fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home,Positive

i bought this kindle for my yr old granddaughter for christmas me and my husband both had kindles several years prior and she and my year old grandson love watching and playing on them both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more my yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube videos and playing games on it he has several game systems xbox sega ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows i m getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good he would like one to call his own i m looking at a gb or gb they are really durable and tough,Positive
for the price this is an excellent tablet i have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost and the foldover design i normally just use it in laptop mode i also have a high end phablet sized phone so i was not sure how often i d use a tablet and did not want to spend ish on an ipad the fire has been a great in between so far on days i use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day and don t have the need to use my laptop the speed is zippy the screen clarity quality is good enough storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable for now i use a gb card giving me a total of gb but the expandable can go up to gb tying into amazon is nice since i have amazon prime basic web surfing email facebook work great the only bad feature is the camera video quality but that does not matter to me since i have my high quality camera video recorder on my phone only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen color brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up running really enjoying the kindle component for book magazine reading as well overall probably the best i have spent in a long time,Positive
after researching and reading endless reviews i bought myself an early christmas present in the amazon echo show once i had it home it was quickly set up and has been a joy to have since day one loved it so much i bought two more as gifts so enjoying being able to see friends and family on a more regular basis with the video option i m sure as i learn more this will become even more useful great addition to my other echo devices,Positive

i have had the echo show for about a month now so this review is from a new user whom has never had smart devices aside from cell phones alexa is great for listening to music most of it free if you re an amazon prime member pair your echo device with a bluetooth speaker for awesome sound alexa works well with smart home devices such as light bulbs outlets and thermostat most of these are really easy to set up so you don t have to be a very technical person all of which can be voice controlled or remotely via the alexa app from your smart phone if you have a friend with an echo show you can make video calls via the devices or directly to a smart phone which is pretty awesome for family and friends whom live far away as far as answering questions do not expect the best answers the bing search engine needs some work if you want to ask the questions she prompts you with on an echo show she s your girl but if you want to know something you might have to look it up yourself ie weather forecast you get whatever bing uses and the short version if bing would expand their horizons in searches i would definitely star this item she does fairly well with recipes and shopping lists i am going to be trying out the calendar sync portion of this with my wife after the holidays all in all very fun helpful item it can order you pizza too,Positive
i have put the dot in the bedroom where my echo is in the living area my family uses her for everything enjoy everything about the echo dot,Positive

even when i m outside in bright sunlight the words of the book i m reading are still crystal clear that alone makes the kindle oasis worth what it cost me the kindle oasis wakes up in just seconds and any book i choose instantly opens ready to be read it is the perfect size and isn t heavy or bulky i really do read for hours at a time sometimes i pace the floor while i read sometimes i m on my elliptical machine when i read and sometimes i m sitting down no matter what i m doing the kindle oasis remains comfortable to hold and it is always easy on my eyes when i receive a book that is in pdf most of the time i can enlarge the words if it won t allow me to enlarge the words i can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger i am able to make notes on the book if needed and i can highlight words and or passages my merlot leather cover is attractive when i flip it open it is just like opening the cover of a book how to make the battery laston the kindle oasis page it says that its dual battery charging system delivers months of battery life this was a huge thing for me instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day i would be able to read for months without charging the kindle is this how my oasis has performed well not so much there are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your oasis to last for two months first you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day that one is impossible for me there are days that i am only able to read for thirty minutes but they don t occur very often my kindle goes everywhere with me and i use just about every spare moment to read second the wireless needs to be turned off that one is easy to do but not always easy to remember the only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books third this is based on your light setting at that is way too low for me i keep my light setting anywhere from to i don t limit my reading to thirty minutes a day and i try to remember to keep my wireless turned off my light setting is kept anywhere from to and i put my kindle to sleep the second i m done reading so how long does a single charge last me ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far but it would have kept a charge for several more days if i had remembered to turn my wireless off once i succeed in keeping my wireless off i will let you know how long the charge lasts now i don t plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low i allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover i allow it to drain down to about before i plug the cover and kindle into my computer to charge the one thing that surprised me was that everything on the oasis is in black and white for some reason i thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color but since i bought the oasis to read books on color isn t needed special offers do appear on my screen but only when my kindle is going to sleep or waking up they aren t a distraction and to be honest they are kind of fun to look at you can pay a higher price so they won t appear on your kindle if you would rather not see them i asked myself some questions once i had my kindle and knew just how it worked if i had known before i bought my kindle oasis that the charge wouldn t last for months would i still have bought it yes i would have if i had known that everything would appear in black and white would i still have bought it yes i would have,Positive

great price of dollars on a great tablet it is very fast at everything accept game play for example it plays asphalt and the game is just barely playable the graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games also it is a amazon tablet with no google play store but you can load google play on to it there are great you tube videos on how to put google play on a amazon tablet the screen is good as long as the sun isn t hitting it the stereo speakers sound great and loud all in all i really liked the tablet for the price but i really like to play games with good graphic quality so that being said i did return this tablet and ordered the nvidia shield inch tablet through best buy for dollars i got the shield a week ago and wow what a difference in graphic gaming quality this thing is just as good as an xbox or ps the nvidia shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of considering the apple or samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with k out to you tv the amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period i don t know why bbuy kind of hides the nvidia tab only on their website and doesn t sell it in the store if they displayed it in the store this would outsell the apple or samsung tablets i hope this helps thanks,Positive

my kindle voyage is nearly months old and worked perfectly i kept receiving emails from amazon about the software update i switched off airplane mode switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up i have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me i will have to buy a new one i am very annoyed if i had left the software as it was my kindle voyage would still be working,Negative

very easy to set up easy to connect with multiple amazon echo dots as well as multiple smart home products,Positive
i bought this for a daughter who would be taking this to school for byod it s perfect size table offers loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member for our need it was good enough but one of the requirement was to have google app support on this since this runs fire os it s everything amazon proprietary there as howto on web on getting google play store and its app on this but the integration with the device lacks upon those fixes from the articles on how to get google app store working on this tablet since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for google apps we re returning it otherwise great tablet but fire os restricts google apps,Positive

so far this tablet has been efficient it kinda bad is difficult to use and it seems to require a lot of steps to get the kids profiles set up and it actually does not do everything i hoped it would,Positive
i use alexa every day i do not know how i lived with out her before,Positive
i have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best the screen was already great on the voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type they didn t include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but i don t think i ll miss it much as i was always wont to fiddle with it on the voyage anyway but this device made me smile as soon as i held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen maybe this isn t a big deal for most but that is exactly why i spent the money to get this device the other thing i was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable the cover is very small and light and doesn t add much bulk like the voyage origami case does the only downside is that it doesn t work as a hands free stand for reading i still wish it was waterproof,Positive
great customer service at best buy i was able to navigate through the product before actually purchasing it i will def be back and highly recommend it,Positive

using for pandora in an office setting set up with older system and speaker system works great,Positive
i was debating whether to get the stationary alexa device or the tap and decided on portability it s been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we re on a roll i use it for play lists at work alarm clock announcement by dan marino and news briefs it s surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so i could take it with me while fishing,Positive
this serves every function i need in a tablet price is right,Positive
this was the perfect gift for my grand kids they love it,Positive
my granddaughter loves this tablet perfect for a year old,Positive
nice it all ready has amazon and apps built in great buy,Positive

this kindle is so overloaded with apps that i will never use despite what one of best buys associates said you cannot remove any of the amazon apps the apps take up too much of the memory i have an i pad and love but bought this as a backup for work unfortunately it bogs down i also don t like that amazon wants access to too much info to set up email so i won t use this for emails either i will likely sell it on craig s list for less than half of what i paid for it,Negative
great product with many functions i would highly recommend it to a friend,Positive

my year old daughter loves this tablet i witnessed her drop it once off the couch to laminate floor nothing i can tell was affected i was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days plus the cost i just had to buy it my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well i can set the tablet so when my older kids and log in they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so i don t have to go searching for it in their rooms at night great tablet glad i got the bumper too great price,Positive

searched around for the perfect tablet for my year old after testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out the year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing the soft foam case provides coverage for drops the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after for the money this tablet cannot be beat only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network overall this is a best buy for the money tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app,Positive

i am happy with my purchase i caught it on sale at a really good price i am normally a real book person but i have a year old who loves ripping up pages the kindle prevents that it s extremely portable it fits better in my purse than a giant book and i have it loaded with lots of books i finish one and start another without having to go store it serves all my needs i picked this one over the paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that i could see was this one wasn t backlit a simple book light from the dollar tree solves that issue this is my second kindle the first being the old keyboard model which i put down because i fell out of love with the keyboard lol and it most likely won t be my last,Positive

i do not like this tablet one bit it has to be registered with amazon for it to function and it failed every time i finally had to resort to calling amazon s customer service also not an easy task to get it registered there seems to be glitch in the programming because when it failed again i had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered i would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company s operations programming or software,Negative

this is my second one and must have one of these at all times,Positive
easy to use good battery life great back lighting,Positive
great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best,Positive
the echo show is great but it is not just plug and play the app directions are not understandable if you are having problems however the amazon hot line was very helpful but who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues all in all i am getting used to the features and like it,Positive

very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages,Positive
i like the price and features of the tablet its great in this price,Positive
this is a great entry level tablet it does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets however at its price point the specs are quite impressive this is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child it is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough overall i highly recommend it,Positive
my first tablet was a kindle i was curious about the updated version very disappointed,Negative

easy to read light in weight has many good features,Positive
the apple watch is great i am very happy with the purchase,Positive
i ve been hesitant to purchase this item didn t feel there was an actual need alexa has changed my mind i use this daily with timers and turning off appliances checking weather and adjusting my heat alexa can even arm the alarm system,Positive
the tablet was a great fit for my month old toddler she is able to watch episodes of her favorite cartoons and play some of the apps with assistance i like that she will be able to use the tablet for years to come just by updating to more age appropriate apps,Positive
my wife loves the tablet she s only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly,Positive
upgraded from a galaxy tablet that was years old so worth it,Positive
this is a very good tablet the only con is you may have to reboot it too often,Positive

love it would definitely recommend to a friend just the right size to hold in one hand and turn pages with the other,Positive
i love this product would really recommend to any one,Positive
i love having the screen available to use for certain tasks like streaming doorbell video security camera footage amazon prime music lyrics and videos but i am disappointed that amazon s implementation of youtube on the echo show violated google s terms of service so they got the app pulled from the show also honestly and anyone can prove it just through everyday use but the echo is just not as useful as google assistant with inquiries it works pretty well with home automation but it just doesn t understand or can t help with about half of the inquiries i throw at it i would have gone with a google home if there was one with a touchscreen i would recommend it for those heavily invested in amazon prime and home automation,Positive
i knew this item would be great but the echo show has exceeded my expectations,Positive
this is the perfect reader price is great it s easy on your eyes battery lasts longer than a tablet,Positive
with a little tweaking you can install playstore without rooting it s a great tablet excellent color fast and battery lasts a very long time,Positive

my only problem with this tablet is if you don t have internet you lose the pictures of the games you have installed and you have to guess to open them,Positive
i have two of these for my kids ages and they are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles books and games on them easy to setup and link to amazon account only gave it stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos kids are less patient than adults you know overall well worth the money,Positive
my year old loves this he can t break it with the thick rubber case and we can control the games he plays and how long he plays great mix of educational and fun items the only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break if they pull it off the charger it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge,Positive

i have had a few kindle s in the past so this was nothing new for me but what i loved about this one is that the screen is big so when i am reading a book it s a lot easier than when i had the first kindle screen i mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when i want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing i love it,Positive
this is a perfect upgrade to my kitchen amazon echo the speaker itself is a substantial upgrade over the echo and dot i have it connected to my nest security cams and it s great to check on my dogs when they are having play time in my fenced backyard it can be a bit distracting with it s random invitations to try certain skills but the distraction is worth it this product absolutely represents the future that i imagined when i first watched back to the future decades ago the only con s that i can think of is sometimes alexa doesn t hear me so well same for the echo and dot and it currently can t differentiate between users like google home can i have had the google home too and would highly recommend any of the amazon devices over the google home,Positive
prior to using the device i decided to recharge it to and was shocked to find out that it takes hours unless you have a lot of time don t buy this device,Negative
the tablet is great and i like the warranty that it comes with but i don t like the charging port the wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don t touch it had to buy an after market cable with an mm plug length to get it to charge we bought of the tablets and they both did the same thing on one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug,Positive
gave it to my husband for his birthday and he loves it he is able to change the screen picture from his phone so there are different pictures everyday nice to tell alexa to keep track of what we need at the store can t wait to use it more,Positive

from her jokes rapping and everyday new fact alexa is awesome its super easy to pull out your phone to check the weather but i honestly never did and would always be surprised when i walked outside with whatever it is that day but every morning i ask alexa whats the weather and she gives me an in depth review for that day and the rest of the week there are tons of skills for alexa most useful some random but shes a must try also plus about the echo plus is if you want to start a smart home you dont need a hub like the other echo pieces you can just buy some compatible smart bulbs,Positive

i bought this kindle paperwhite for my son to use at school instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet the display options make it adaptable for just about anyone and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight the kindle is durable and although i bought a case for it a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it the most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life my son is an avid reader and noticed that he needs to charge his kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet,Positive
this is such a great addition to our house amazon echo plus is incredible for all the things it is capable of doing,Positive
i have had a kindle for some time and was curious about the oasis it did not disappoint it is very compact even with the cover and fits in a coat pocket i really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons great device for home or on the go,Positive

i have been a kindle owner since they first came out this version has many many more bells and whistles but i still use mine mostly for books audible books and a place for me to download music i can listen to when i travel sometimes it is a bit slow opening up different apps and functions but overall it is functional dependable and useful to me,Positive
like having another person in the house i talk to alexa more then my wife,Positive
speaker has great sound and it s awsome that it syncs with other speakers to really fill your house with sound the smart lights i wasn t too sure of but since i ve installed it i want to get more it s a great smarthome hub,Positive
my gf loved it and uses it all the time she gets books she wanted to follow up on,Positive
i love my amazon fire hd it s not too small and not too big i was looking at other tablets and decided on the amazon fire hd because of the price and because i have amazon prime i purchased it online at best buy and then picked it up at the store on black friday it is my first tablet and so i wanted to start with one that i can have fun with and i am i do have a laptop for important things,Positive

the best kindle i have ever used it does everything,Positive
my children really enjoy this tablet we have tried other brand tablets and those were not too kid friendly even though they were kid tablets and i found them a little advanced for my children s ages so this tablet was perfectly age appropriate and with a bigger memory than the previous no complaints,Positive
i love this tablet works great for my needs ebooks facebook light gaming internet is a little slow but it s what can i say i installed google chrome for more apps,Positive
amazon hit it out of the park with this one i am able to connect this to nest cams and ring cams as well songs come with lyrics sound and looks great,Positive
even though the ppi is lower than the other tablets i didn t really notice it i like the letterbox format which allows the use of more of the screen area when viewing movies and tv,Positive
i purchased this for my children who are separated by miles can t wait for them to open their gifts,Positive
i purchased this as a second alexa couldn t figure out why it came with the hue light bulb until i learned that the new version of alexa has a built in hub it s a gift for my spouse but i can t wait to set it up and get more bulbs to automate our home lighting,Positive
this is a very good reader for the money very versatile,Positive
my son loves it he now wants to add more for alexa to use,Positive
i am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd the picture is awesome even for a movie i use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice i have a inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile plus there was a great black friday price,Positive
awesome all around product great picture and like the voice control,Positive
much sleeker and touch response is better even wifi connection seems faster might be due to new processor and increase in ram,Positive
i bought this as a light weight alternative to an ipad for collecting and enjoying kindle and amazon video products when combined with the dedicated fire cover it s low price along with a very readable screen and the option for a micro sd card make it an excellent choice for travel and time spent in waiting rooms etc allowing lots of memory space for ones library as well as flexibility regarding how it is held or positioned,Positive

this speaker has a great sound and its perfect to take out on the patio or in any room that i am in the tap is annoying compared to the echo with voice activation but the wireless features makes the purchase worth it,Positive
same as echo but with a screen which adds to the appeal to this product,Positive
asking trivia questions of alexa is a hoot but being able to turn off the ceiling fan from bed is golden,Positive
ok so i normally do not like this kind of stuff but to be honest alexa has been great not only do we use it for fun stuff like music while cooking or being able to multi task much easier it fit in seamlessly with our home security system added a extra cam and really does add something extra to the home,Positive
lot to learn but great device connecting to other devices can be frustrating but over time should be better connect to my bose blue tooth speaker then tried the dot seems connection can be to only one device at a time still checking help app but limited info,Positive
i bought this because the package said it was a fast charger only to find it charges at normal speed that was disappointing i m pretty sure i m not doing anything wrong it seems pretty self explanatory,Neutral
excellent sound and fun very portable and easy to carry in backpack all the features of echo and echo dot but you must tap the button before speaking,Positive
using for pandora in an office setting set up with older system and speaker system works great,Positive
nice except unlike a google home you can t just ask it to play music you eventually have to purchase their music after s free trial,Positive
great price and works great for book reading would recommend,Positive
bought devices for my kids they report its simple to start up easy to use and fun,Positive

bought this for my cousins and he absolutely loves it,Positive
great product easy to use and would recommend to anyone,Positive
purchased the echo plus after reading that the new generation had been upgraded by improving the sound and integration of a controller for the price provided i thought that the deal was a good value i have the first generation unit as well a quick comparison of the two from a sound look etc perspective really didn t lead me to think that there was any noticeable sound improvement nor improved aesthetics at least the price for the unit has come down quite a bit and the addition of philips bulb for free was a smart move overall i think that the unit is a good purchase for beginning some home automation projects,Positive
this is just what i was looking for it does just what it says it does,Positive
great item and easy to use very helpful and entertaining,Positive
got for my parents as a gift simple to use and they like it got on sale so was good value,Positive
great tablet with a lot of features great price too,Positive
i have an amazon prime account so i started downloading apps and playing all kinds of music on this i also can control my hue hub you need one for certain timers and things and wemo plus outlets for my non wifi lights and led s in the kitchen cabinets,Positive
it s great to some extent but i was expecting more it s unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps perhaps i m not using them correctly i m still learning,Positive
our grand kids really love this tablet and it has a lot of app options,Positive
my son thoroughly enjoys having this tablet and i love the protective case that comes with it,Positive
i love this unit very well designed and built it s very easy to use and has a huge amount of features the screen is beautiful but the audio could use a bit more bass imho i bought for christmas gifts,Positive
purchased this as a gift for my wife because her b n nook was dying she absolutely loves it especially since it does so much more i m now waiting for my nook to start acting up so that i have an excuse to get a kindle for myself,Positive
didnt know how much i d use a kindle so went for the lower end im happy with it even if its a little dark,Positive
my granddaughters love the kid kindles that they received for christmas,Positive
i love my tablet it is super easy and loads fast,Positive
i already has an older version of the kindle but this one is even better i love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons,Positive
bought second one for my mom and she loves it so much,Positive
love this just replaced my old echo with this one love alexa,Positive
i have both a st gen echo and now the new echo plus i am impressed with the sound quality improvement especially the bass don t get me wrong it s no bose system but it sounds great for every day use,Positive
i just like reading amd playing games on it better then those bulky computers,Positive
got it when it was on sale totally fall in love with it bring with it me everywhere,Positive
will definitely keep buying kindle fire from best buy,Positive
the echo is a great addition for my busy household the voice commands to play music is excellent the fact i can sit on my couch and control the lights and other items just by saying what i want is just amazing,Positive
great tablet for the kids to play games and watch shows,Positive
this is so much better than the echo dot the smart hub is pretty cool,Positive
i previously purchased two of these for two other grandkids and they just love them and so does mom she can set time limits can limit access and much more plus it comes with a two year guarantee if the child breaks it they will replace it did i mention that there is a sd expansion card slot to increase the storage capacity these grandkids are to in age but older kids would enjoy this also,Positive
i love my amazon show it s a recommended product if you wanna have this item however the down sides are it has a great speaker so if it s full max it may be hard for alexa to hear you another downside google hates amazon not youtube,Positive
bought for wife who is not into the techie word she likes it suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it,Positive
salesman told me the big one was better so i bought it my daughter gave me the small one for christmas does the same thing salesmen are apparently undertrained or a bunch of liars,Positive
i love everything about it except the glare great product though easy to use great movie quality as well i just wish i could read it on the beach,Positive
works great i am looking forward to purchase more for the diffrent rooms in my house,Positive
this product works great i really enjoy having alexa follow commands,Positive
i have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best the screen was already great on the voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type they didn t include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but i don t think i ll miss it much as i was always wont to fiddle with it on the voyage anyway but this device made me smile as soon as i held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen maybe this isn t a big deal for most but that is exactly why i spent the money to get this device the other thing i was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable the cover is very small and light and doesn t add much bulk like the voyage origami case does the only downside is that it doesn t work as a hands free stand for reading i still wish it was waterproof,Positive
had to get this tablet it was a great price and came with free amazon movies for a year i just had to change the case,Positive
bought as a christmas gift works good with no problems,Positive
bought this mostly as a backup and to read a few books since i have a larger cell phone and a back up used it occasionally may or hours of use till this week when i sent my laptop in for repairs so i probably used it a tot this week i was watching my rd primetime video this week and it simply turned off it will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode it is gone it is toast bought it october it quit on february my old fire lasted or years with more use it had stereo speakers lasted a week on a charge not or days sturdier built this is full of junk i am not just offered more apps it is constantly trying to add them junk junk junk,Negative
i will have one for all my rooms i will also buy some for friends,Positive
this is the best kindle ereader yet the size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading you will find yourself reading more books than ever with it,Positive
what i like is it its sound it s portable and i use it at work the sound fills the whole office,Positive
omg i love my amazon show it is sooo cool and does a lot of cool stuff,Positive
purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it made her christmas this year,Positive
so yesterday evening i decided to purchase an amazon echo is the machine intrusive yeah i guess it could be if you allow it i purchased it because of its home automation and other fantastic capabilities just to name a few of those capabilities with a subscription you will have an unprecedented amount of music you can listen to that in itself was worth it some other things include sports travel recipes and traffic the home automation part lock doors turn on lights random lighting when on vacation,Positive
i have the hd and an hdx and the outperforms them both if you are an amazon fan of the eco system this is a must the screen is bright and crisp the processor performs very well with the latest software update i love it,Positive
i love my echo show elexa is so helpfull she answers just about every question i have,Positive
this item is a great addition to your smart home but just as the first gen siri it is not all there yet the kinks still needs to be worked out alexa does not have answers to a lot of things or commands there s a long learning curve setting up with apps is a lot work it s fun if your large circle is willing to spend the money to get one each great landline replacement,Positive
awesome so far have used it as alarm clock stereo nd screen for movies while multitasking on pc news weather audiobooks and more the news flash can repeat itself at times but i may have subscribed to too many subcategories but a quick alexa next skips right ahead still learning the variations of commands and sometimes it hears what it wants to until i have to ar tic u late to the point of annoyance but hey this is still relatively new tech and who would have imagined this years or more ago,Positive
this is a very good product the speakers are good the price was right i liked everything about it other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it unlike the echo and the dot the portability was good but i didn t have much use for it being portable unless you are going to keep the tap within arm s reach you re better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products recommended with caveats,Positive
this thing is really cool love that it gives all the words to songs,Positive
love it love it love it,Positive
my year old son loves his kindle he can fully work it himself we love all the he age appropriate games learning apps and books the case is great for all those accidentally drops,Positive
i bought this as a gift for my sister and every time i see her she is using it she does not have a computer or internet at home and is very dependent on the library this works so well for her a stop anywhere there is free wifi and she is online so much tech utility for such a low price,Positive
reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd so i guess that is what counts,Positive
it is easy for little ones to use great beginner buy,Positive
i purchased this tablet mostly for entertainment i enjoy playing games and this tablet is great for that purpose also plan on using it for reading electronic books,Positive
i absolutely love this product it does so many things not the least of which is music ask it anything and it will answer,Positive
extra features don t really seem worth it i would just buy the basic one instead,Positive
good tablet satisfied one point annoying silk browser makes yahoo email a list and have to tap html to read each one awkward,Positive
purchased for my sister for reading books internet and games perfect for beginners and novices easy to use would be a five if available with g,Positive
it s so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights or play music so convenient love this,Positive
my daughter bought this with her birthday money she loves it and is always playing it,Positive
he echo show is great i can use it to monitor my outside inside cameras,Positive
this is a great reader it feels like the best evolution of the paperwhite the auto brightness works fine and is unnoticeable and it feels good in the hands the new page squeeze feature is nice as is the haptic feedback when you squeeze the bezel the power button is also much better placed now and the glass screen makes swiping and tapping the bookmark and location corner areas much easier the backlight is now much more uniform than my st gen paperwhite the only issue i have is when displaying black blocks like the tree silhouette i have what looks like a tiny bad pixel that kind of twinkles and of course this thing is expensive when compared to the paperwhite,Positive
i love this tablet one of the best out there on the market,Positive
video quality is very good works well with amazon prime video and music no surprises there apps are very disappointing many common apps are not available even though there are android versions not bad if you have modest expectations,Positive
like having pictures and weather on the screen and news up dates,Positive
it s was on sale on this color put the play store and made it real android tablet,Positive
boxed well easy to set up and pretty easy to get the hang of,Positive
bought for my wife to upgrade from the original kindle that she has worn out big step up from the original and should be good for another years,Positive
gave as christmas gift and wife loved it she has not put it down since she has gotten it,Positive
good item for children and is very inexpensive easy to hold and has a cover designed for it,Positive
for the money i highly recommended it it is great when linked to netflix disney movies etc,Positive
i looked at multiple other brands some cheaper by bucks this is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for years drinks have spilled on it its been dropped thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it,Positive
love alexa especially the touch screen can play games like jeopardy,Positive
i had trouble linking to my joule cooking app finally got on the third day i love it now still is learning voice recognition though,Positive
super easy to set up and use got one for daughter and got one for self,Positive
my yr old son loves his tablet he takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained,Positive
love this product super easy to use and able to have a lot of fun with this with entertaining guests and ourselves,Positive
the future of reading you just have this and it is like a whole library,Positive
received an echo plus as a christmas present absolutely love it we went back purchased a dot more light bulbs,Positive
nice tablet for my year old daughter affordable charging battery can be frustrating at time normally have to hit power button to turn off and back on after you plug into outlet to charge or it will take many hours to charge it is almost like it allows the tablet to reset to charge,Positive
good for convenience when other devices are tied up but the keyboard lags a little slower than i would like,Positive
good tablet for the price its quick and easy to use,Positive
this was a black friday special and we knew we wanted a smart home assistant and alexa worked well with the ring doorbell system there are times when you have to ask her the same thing over and over until she figures it out but overall it was a food deal,Positive
i have both the echo and the tap they are spectacular,Positive
so far so good wife very happy misses her old one,Positive
excellent product relable maximum speed fast downloading,Positive
love the shopping lists feature listening to music having so much fun,Positive
great price for product it s get of you have kids,Positive
i or a family member have owned every version of the kindle since it came out this version has finally taken all of the best elements of the previous kindles and combined them into one unit it is small and light has both touch screen and button functionality depending on which you prefer i m a fan of the buttons and an excellent back light kindle battery life has always been excellent and is no different here i use my kindle daily often for at least an hour at a time the only downside is that i m not sure what other features amazon could add to improve this version other than perhaps making it lighter weight by far the best e reader out there and a worthy upgrade from a previous version,Positive
my grandson really enjoyed this product good deal,Positive
i have not had a chance to use the hub function on this device but it was easy to set up and get running still learning how to make it work with the other echo devices but overall it operates as advertised,Positive
easy to use and love all the things i can do on it,Positive
have been using my kindle app on my ipad for years but now can t imagine using anything besides my kindle to read love the backlight so i can read at night,Positive
this fit my criteria of a low cost tablet that works well,Positive
my grandson loved this he is and it was perfect,Positive
i love this kindle i am biased i think however i have had previous ones i prefer kindles to any other tablet,Positive
i bought this about a month ago and i really like it the best part is light in weight sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it comes with batterey charger the voice command activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radios from tunein,Positive
this is excellent for kids the only thing i don t like is it is difficult to go to kids web pages by typing in an web address once you set up the kids profile plus it takes away the easy access of the camera which the kids love i may have set it up wrong as it did not come with printed instructions and i am not tech savvy this item is extremely durable and great fun for the kids,Positive
i love the tablets hd picture is beautiful the fire tablet is very fast to load and is easy to use great tablet,Positive
i bought my fire hd as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college the fact that i saved well over on one of the books i had to get this semester was a godsend most all undergraduate courses i have seen are offered in ebook form for kindle if you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without wifi or other hotspot it s a great resource pros price for this was still less than the money saved for my biology book a lot less weight that college textbooks so far all books i need for college are available as ebooks through amazon a single charge can make it through an hour school day cons if you want need a network connection you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another wifi network bottom line i wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over in books around i came out at well under considering i bought this,Positive

amazon echo show working very well as expected and thanks to amazon for adding more features on regular basis,Positive
i like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage,Positive
alexa show is really well put together the main reason for my purchase was to create my own surveillance system linking my ring doorbell and ring floodlights to view on command by alexa on the show screen yes you can talk to it and get results for almost any query but with the show you get a lot more the touch screen is great for video calls especially when you install the alexa app on your family cell phones alexa can scan items via upc and order them on amazon or tell you where to get them the recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you but shown to you also when music plays you can see the lyrics on screen if you use amazon music to play the music you can ask for a news briefing and you see the news highlights etc the speakers aren t quite up to the same standard as the echo series but it s close the sound fills the room nicely when the echo show is not being immediately used the screen shows a picture of your choice making it a digital frame too overall the device is very nice and they are constantly releasing new skills for alexa to use so it seems like there is always something new to wow you turning on and off lights adjusting your thermostat playing music viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties there is way more to do with this device,Positive
we use them for classes they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals,Positive

first of all this is not an ipad or a more expensive android tablet but it s a very good tablet for the money i own an ipad pro and ipad air yet this tablet has a place in my home if you re buying for kids i wouldn t buy anything more expensive than this good screen fast enough and amazon s underground free apps are a huge plus,Positive

great product exactly what i ve come to expect from my kindle readers,Positive
this tablet is not a high tech state of the art speed demon but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use the two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with alexa built in and you can download amazon movies to the device to watch offline for example on an airplane these two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price,Positive
we already own kindles so we know they are great my son is going to live this,Positive
i use this while underway and it s a perfect size to travel with,Positive
this is a steal have gb model as well this has more punch,Positive

i purchased the amazon fire kids edition tablet gb for my year old mother after she broke her old tablet by dropping it it took her a few hours to get used to it now i cannot separate her away from it because it entertains her in so many ways and best of all she can drop the tablet and it will still work,Positive

i bout this item for my granddaughter for christmas it has games that she enjoys playing the case protects the device very well it also can be set up for age appropriate games etc as she gets older you can change that it is bigger than an ipod and smaller than an ipad and has a better price since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps,Positive

much harder to work than an android none of the wallpaper apps i downloaded from the kindle store work on the device many of the other apps look cheap on the display other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper tablet they make it look like an android tablet but it is not no google play everything is just harder to work than on a regular android but for a tablet under it exceeds expectations it is more responsive than other models of fire,Neutral

when they first announced the kindle oasis i did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my st generation kindle paperwhite just as i felt when they announced the voyage i read a lot so my kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time i have never had an issue with battery life i have only had it get really low a few times typically when i was traveling so again i originally did not see a lot of the value to the oasis as the reviews for the oasis came out i started to realize what i did not like about my paperwhite and i began to have an interest in upgrading my paperwhite to the either the oasis or possibly the voyage the main thing i noticed is that i took my paperwhite out of the amazon case quite a lot especially when i was in a seated position this slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions i had some other minor issues with my paperwhite like when reading in the dark i couldn t find an adjustment for the light that i preferred was a little too dim and was a brighter than i needed i decided to pass on the voyage because i really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option now that i have the oasis i definitely think it was worth it for me i really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the paperwhite it provides the same reading experience although i did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older paperwhite which is a plus the oasis is really comfortable in my hand which helps me forget that it is there when i was holding my paperwhite with my left hand at times i would accidentally go back a page which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience i have the black model because it was the only option available unless i was willing to wait a few more months the build quality of the oasis and its case is very nice just like with the paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it the only concern i have is how well it will protect the kindle i will update the review if i find this to be a problem i loved my paperwhite and i will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older kindle or buying one for the first time it definitely is great and the better buy but i am glad i decided to order the oasis the reduced weight ergonomic design and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost,Positive
may grandson loves this went on a long car trip and he was able to watch movies and keep entertained,Positive
gave this to my sister in law for mother s day its a great entry level tablet she loves using it especially for games,Positive
very pleased based upon reviews i did expect the speaker to be louder and have a bit better sound but not a big deal for big sound just turn on the stereo,Positive

i got this product for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it he uses it all the time for reading when i held it myself i couldn t believe how small and lightweight it was very cool,Positive
it s easy and intuitive the only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application instead of watching an advertisement then having to figure out how to exit it,Positive
i bought this tablet for my son and i don t like it the touch screen is very poor quality it s hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game he prefers my ipad than to use his own i know the ipad quality is probably the best quality but it s way under that very frustrating will be returning it,Negative
it great to have in the home it has become invaluable,Positive

my year old grandson enjoys playing with his tablet i say playing because he thinks most of the programs on it are games that he can play at some point he will probably realize that while enjoying the games he is also learning he enjoys it a lot,Positive
bought a few kindles in the past but this time one of it came defective the port was bent and it was hard to charge but still possible comes in different color was gb enough space for kids has camera ok quality not the best but ok for pics taken by kids,Neutral
got this for my daughter in law and she loves it does exactly what she needs it to do,Positive
the last models of kindle hdx have been terrible we have purchased of each model of kindle and up until the last models they have been great last years had to be replaced or times and for the same problem the slot for the sd card is defective i gave up and bought the newest model it shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason it s going back after the first of the year this is going to be my last year for kindles unless they make them the same quality as before phooey,Negative
i love my echo show screen is so clear and sound is so high quality,Positive

very nice kindle with a great battery life my old kindle was not able to upgrade so i got the new kindle and very pleased with the product arrived as promised from bestbuy com,Positive
nice camera learning how to use it but it is easy,Positive
pretty fun little gadget kids love playing with it not even sure of all the things it can do yet,Positive
bought this gift for my wife and she loves it works as expected,Positive
as an existing amazon prime member this is a no brainer has all the parental controls and kids can have a decent tablet that is durable for use at a good price,Positive
good size for reading and screen is easy to read even in sun light this was very easy to read and it fit into n small bag to carry around,Positive
the kindle fire is small but does everything it should for a young child worth the low cost i paid for it,Positive
for its price this a great little tablet it does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason i gave it rather than stars hopefully amazon will allow it to perform better soon,Positive
i wanted to try out this technology it is cool sometimes i would prefer not to hear alexa s reply when i ask her to turn the light on,Positive
this kindle allows me to download several books it easily fits in a purse and is light weight,Positive
battery life isn t great but overall for what i paid it is a good tablet for my kids i did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when i returned to the store to exchange it the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so despite being elite plus and being under days that aside it s a good tablet but i was very disappointed in the customer service issue,Positive
i ve wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when bb put it on sale i am not disappointed,Positive
i love my kindle black i can read for hours without making my eyes sore the way a phone screen would the functions are easy to use everything is set up clearly and simply it s shape is adorable and it s surprisingly light the battery does last a long time,Positive
echo show is a great tool in the kitchen paired with amazon music it makes the time go by quickly video selection could be better somehow needs to strike a deal with google for access to youtube video it does have nice video for recipes,Positive
i am a senior citizen who is not that great on computers or tablets therefore i need a book to help me understand how to do things on the tablet i could not believe that this tablet did not come with an instruction booklet it s taking me some time but i am learning how to get around this thing that s why i can only give this product stars instead of,Positive
my daughter loves that it is pink and she enjoys watching videos playing on the tablet which is what really matters sufficient and cheaper alternative to the more expensive tablet alternatives,Positive
it s neat it does what all other amazon alexis do but a little more i feel as if should still do more,Neutral
it was ok you need internet the sdmini is a hassle,Neutral
addition to my system love talking and seeing my bff in atl suits my office decor,Positive
this is my third alexa and combined with my fire tv and now the lights my couch time has increased love the new technology,Positive
so we added this to our echo family of devices it s nice to have screen but i honestly don t find i use it as much as i thought i would the video calling feature would be pretty great if we knew more people with a video capable echo device also we ve had some technical issues that i haven t been able to resolve as of yet ultimately this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter it s also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras but you should probably investigate it s features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more traditional echo devices it s essentially an alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker so something to think about,Positive
we purchased the echo show after using the dot for a couple of weeks the first thing i noticed is that the dot s ability to pick up your voice is by far much better than the show however i think the show s speaker is better for listening to music the screen on the show is handy for looking at recipes seeing the shopping list or watching the timer could you live with just the dot absolutely but there are some nice features that make the show a handy gadget to have around,Positive
great speaker for around the house listening to music and asking questions,Positive
my son love this and it s his favorite piece of technology so far,Positive
my kids read books play games take pictures they love this,Positive
great tablet for the price it was a christmas present and so far so good,Positive
very easy to use and good quality nice picture and good size for a desk,Positive
this is a very nice concept and i think it will take on more usefulness as alexa gains more skills the design is a little clunky google s version looks nicer but i already has alexa devices to tie in to,Positive
i bought this for my daughter wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games like with the kindle fire this latest version of the kindle is excellent i am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle the touchscreen is responsive if you like reading on the kindle it is worth the update,Positive
this tablet does all i need a tablet to do reason why it s my rd one,Positive
it has a great camera and i really enjoy my games and facebook on this larger screen than my phone i love not using my data up on my phone,Positive
it s nice but not as easy to switch profiles as i would like for it being a child s tablet but overall easy to use just a lot of junk on main profile,Positive
love to rad my books with my kindle and download straight from my device so easy and safe lovit thanks best buy,Positive
i bought this for my moms birthday and she loves it,Positive
wanted something to use while charging my ipad easy to use,Positive
works great with wemo and philips hue great sound and voice recognition,Positive
i wasn t sure how we would like the tap but i must say it has been fun talking to alexa i like asking her to tell me a joke play my favorite radio station or play music the fun continues as i add apps and alexa expands her knowledge base,Positive
not a real fan of ai but alexa has become quite handy entertaining and informative the show itself allows us to contact family that is in florida and teleconference with them in simple step shows family photos stored in amazon account one word simply amazing bought for my parents and they use it,Positive
i enjoy taking photos with me and having enough videos to keep the kids entertained on the fence go with the larger storage,Positive
i have used kindle e readers since amazon introduced them years ago all are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade the oasis is no exception even from the highly touted voyage model it is expensive but the lightweight design improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently this is definitely a good investment,Positive
used it and looks very paper like they integrated the simplest form of an e reader which makes it stand out for its use,Positive
it does its job but i would buy one which the screen is brighter there are times that it s difficult to read because screen is not too bright,Neutral
bought this with the intention of reading more it serves it s purpose i will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew for his books and learning games,Positive
i bought this for a family member with a disability i didn t see any reviews for this purpose but so far it is working well i felt the case would help if it was accidentally dropped,Positive
is nice for reading sometimes the screen is a little slow hate the ads on the main screen,Positive
so i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job a guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome i loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such its portable its got clean and crisp sound it also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all,Positive
it s a good tablet for kids the only thing i really don t like is the fact that you need to put in a credit card to be able to get apps but other than that is ok,Positive
i like this kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older amazon kindle fire,Positive

in my opinion this model is too small and feels cheap and sd card slot,Neutral
love it bought one for everyone in the family i know they ll love it too,Positive
it was just what i was looking for so far i have had no issues with it,Positive
i have really enjoyed these products so much i actually bought of them fun to watch and even better if you are an amazon prime customer for music and video,Positive
i particularly like the fact that the text shows up and you can see it well outside on a sunny day i use it with kindle unlimited,Positive

very easy to set up i mostly control the lights with my hue cell phone app very convenient i have lamps hooked up to the light bulbs now i plan on doing most of my house in the future i listen to music and get weather updates from the echo my husband uses the echo as an alarm,Positive
pretty cool product features are limited unless you spend a lot more money buying other things you can connect and interface with but the basic unit with one lightbulb is a pretty good start just know going into it that you will be shelling out a lot more to expand the system,Positive

nice device we use it a lot in the kitchen and the home automation,Positive
i loved this thing until it was time to go to bed although it dims the lowest setting is still very bright like sleeping with a flashlight in your face i hope they make fixes that will allow the screen to dim more also not crazy about having a camera connected to the internet on my nightstand if you cover it up the motion sensor then won t work the sound is ok not quite as good as the non screen echo maybe because it s not omni directional like the regular echo my enthusiasm for this device has subsided quite a bit because of these issues,Neutral

the price for this tablet is not the only great selling point the free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son there are tons of games books and videos in this service my favorite feature is how we can set time limits on screen time we can even set it to require an amount of learning app or book time per day before access to games is allowed great choice for kids,Positive
bought this tablet to replace a year old galaxy tab this tablet is quick and easy to use relatively streamlined the screen is nice and the stereo speakers while tiny sound better than my old tablet the modified android system that amazon is running on this tablet is good just a bit restrictive all in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps pros price performance feels sturdy easy to navigate silk browser works greatcons not all apps are supported on here like telegram ads on lock screen feel unnecessary but not a hindrance not as customizable as other android tabs,Positive

an amazing electronic tool so portable great storage books great convenience,Positive
this product while the speaker is great fails to deliver with a voice interface use your cell phone or computer and buy an echo dot,Neutral

i the awesome i use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where,Positive
loud speaker very responsive makes it easier that the smart hub is built into it than having to buy another piece of equipment,Positive

this is our first echo so nothing to compare it to but so far so good sound is great fun to use and has been helpful for information needed quickly,Positive

purchased this device at launch pack for xx and now youtube doesn t work youtube was one of the main features that i used without youtube you ll be better off buying the echo dot instead,Negative
great camera for a beginner very easy to understand,Positive
i was a ook user and have been converted to kindle the size is great and it is very responsive got one for me and one as a gift,Positive
solid amazon echo love they have added phillips hub into the product so you do not need a hub voice response is a little touchy compared to other echos,Positive
this item seems great on the ads but it reality it can t do nearly as much to get it to do more you have to download skills some of which work well and others of which do not some are reviewed but many are not connecting is often difficult and sometimes the password you use has to be the same as your alexa device which no body tells you i m sure with some practice this device will be fun and useful but learning to use it and sorting through the skills is a pain,Neutral
i purchase one for my children and us is a great way to stay connected and smart to have it at home,Positive
the sales people are really nice and knowledgeable to me i will come back again,Positive
i love my echo plus the hub makes it easy to add devices to my smarthome and alexa is a great addition,Positive

i bought this device for my wife and she loves it plays videos for cooking on gift list for sure,Positive
i love this tablet it s the perfect size i can do everything on it and it was affordable,Positive
rating this has to be one of the best ai products i have used in a while the screen for an smart home device can be very useful it really can t compete with the google home because the show just brings convenience without having to call it i primarily use the show to turn on off my smart lights simple cooking measurements simple math travel time store location hours calling and video calling and more everything else like news calendars weather are already displayed on screen definitely worth it if you plan on using all the minimum features above,Positive
it a great tablet for children but it doesnt work with google apps,Positive
this is actually a pretty good little tablet it is not the most powerful and it doesn t have the highest resolution screen but for the price you can t go wrong it does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won t feel much pain if you break it a perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips,Positive
my granddaughter like s her tablet she has learning a lot the case is durable and i was glad that the case came in pink,Positive
well made and profrssional looking operating manual clear and complete,Positive

it made a great christmas present for my wife plus i get it too works great great order and delivery from best buy,Positive
i thought long and hard about upgrading from my paperwhite but decided to do so despite not beating able to actually see one in the store i have owned a kindle since the second generation version this is by far my favorite the look and feel are amazing i don t regret the purchase one bit as i have the disposable income to do so but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point,Positive
the specs are good feels solid can t stand the os too many ads you can t get rid of not as customizable as i d like if that doesn t bother you it s a good tablet for the price don t expect to run games on it not powerful enough for that,Neutral
nice item and cute the tablet is difficult to navigate,Positive

i love that you and now see your answer on a screen with the alexa echo show,Positive
i purchased two of these tablet a pink and blue they was for my and years children they really love their tablets yes it was a birthday gift,Positive
the unit does a good job of playing music from amazon music it hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when i tell it to turn on a particular lamp and i have to slowly pronunciate it like that the music shows the lyrics do need a family account on amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though,Positive
i have one alexa and three echo dots and having echo show now is awesome,Positive
at first i was concerned with the funny looking angle i saw on the pictures the item was not displayed at the local store so i decided to take a chance as an owner of the echo dot i figured it would work in the same manner and it does i love that it works with the arlo pro the screen is great and i soon figured out the reason for the funny angle of the item the angled screen works great only setback or recommendation would be to add a auxiliary output at the rear also you can watch prime movies youtube videos etc,Positive
i bought this for my grandson and he loves it great,Positive
it s beyond my expectation and it can even show music score not fast turning though,Positive
bought this for my mom that is electronically challenged and she loves it makes her feel like she is a tech wiz makes me feel better about her ability to turn lights on and off as she comes and goes more importantly she is in her s and iives alone she can make a phone call using alexa from anywhere she has an echo i bought her to cover her whole house this means if she falls down and can t get to her phone she can dial me or with her voice a must have,Positive
my granddaughter loved it she used it for her school work,Positive
received as a christmas gift really works well we can turn the living room light on and off from anywhere with cell phone so you don t need to remember to plug in a timer when going away plays amazon music and sound is amazing,Positive

i have grown very accustomed to having alexa around there are new skills added on a very regular basis i really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song radio station podcast to be played i also enjoy having books read to me since i m not much of a reader the setup was super simple so simple that i wasn t sure that i was all ready to go with such minimal effort the battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine i feel that there is a bright future for the tap and i am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer i m not sure i needed this item but i can t imagine not having it around now so pleased with this purchase,Positive
hard to use no way to delete things from screen need better manual most books are impossible if they are reference books,Positive

this tablet is designed primarily to sell distribute and store media purchased from the amazon com product line ie kindle e books movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service etc and it does that very well reasonably sharp screen good sound good battery life and decent component materials it uses their version of the android os which they call the fire os which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the google play store but must rely on amazon s own app store which is decent but not as extensive as either apple s or google s,Positive

this is my third echo and the video screen is a nice addition i d like to give it stars but not an option the only thing that s is not as good as my previous ones is that i feel the microphone does not understand me as well also at this point the screen has a lot of potential but not much is implemented yet e g watch cable tv over internet,Positive
it works great it is handy to use to look stuff up fast and has some great features i added a memory card to add movies and it works great for that at a great price,Positive
i can t update facebook and a few other apps it s not what i expected,Negative
i had the echo previously but having the screen opens up more options for alexa i find it helpful to be able to glance at the screen and see things like time and weather i also have cameras setup and i can use alexa to view these feeds while the unit is kind of large it is stable and supports touch i haven t tried video calling or playing videos but the screen quality seems pretty good,Positive

i was skeptical about the amazon echo products why would i need this i bought the echo dot first and was hooked bought this echo plus for smart home integration since then i have bought a bunch of smart bulbs and plan on more things i bought an echo spot too you do not need an echo product but they are fun practical and cool can t live without it now,Positive
bought these for my grand children for christmas and they have thoroughly enjoyed using their tablets and the apps that can easily be saved on the tablet,Positive
this product was purchased for my grandson he had a fire he however loves the hd he uses it for music gaming mostly great electronic device,Positive
the amazon fire tablet is awesome my kids love it,Positive
not an ipad but that s not what i wanted high quality does everything i need it to do,Positive
love the sound i have a google home and is not as loud as this echo,Positive

kindle products are easy to use and set up it does most everything the expensive tablets do,Positive
the ui experience is great especially for prime members the tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task,Positive
i was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for,Neutral
gave it to my grandkids ages for christmas and they loved it,Positive
love the bigger screen but do think this fire hd th runs a little slow my last fire hd was not as slow,Positive
this is the best tablet i ve ever purchased the screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my year old loves it makes me jealous and want to get a kindle but that s ok i can use parent most while he s sleeping all over a really good tablet for both parent and child,Positive
only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the kindlefire with any light in the room at all far worse than impossible in sunlight there should be some sort of temporary screen or other add on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations,Positive
the amazon hd is by far the best budget tablet if you just need a tablet to browse the web and watch videos this tablet is the way to go that being said it is fairly slow but who cares if you do not use the tablet for photo video editing gaming picture taking etc,Positive
this is the second one i bought my grandkids love them,Positive
good one and working without any issues slim and portable,Positive
great to talk and see family at anytime easy to use,Positive

i bought this item for my year old son he loves it and it has nice feaures such as parental controls,Positive
if you love amazon you ll love the kindle hd it s a great size for reading all those books streaming movies and tv shows and has great sound for listening to your favorite music for less than you can t beat the versatility of this little device,Positive
i bought this because i recently signed up for amazon prime and wanted to take advantage of the free books nice tablet,Positive
i was looking to upgrade from my old kindle reader and stumbled on the fire hd which is not only a reader but a tablet as well fairly easy to use i really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well i wish it supported all google play apps and not just amazon apps but i can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose but when i want to read in the middle of the night getting to the web can be distracting,Positive
a good product that provides the services i desire,Positive
i bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters great item and just as nice as the more expensive one she absolutely loves it,Positive
the battery doesn t last as long as was advertised if you have the money i would recommend the backlit model,Positive

got it as a gift for my grandma and she loves it,Positive
i own a dot and a first gen echo and the sound from the show is way better than both of my other echoes the video functions are nice but it is a pain to get it to play videos from my amazon library my family enjoys the calendar info and the news briefings that rotate on the screen,Positive
perfect for reading but also has many other functions downloaded my favorite games travel apps set up easy so far works great,Positive
got two for my mom s and they love it so many great features,Positive
staff was very helpful and polite went in asked for help and was pointed in the right direction,Positive
i like the tablet however there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on i probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed,Positive
the images are crisp and text very easy to read apps are good and easy to navigate love it,Positive
this is just the perfect item for what we needed it is compact and can go anywhere with you,Positive
the echo show with video screen is a nice upgrade to the other echo s news briefs with videos are nice very good sound quality for playing music,Positive
my kids love this product it keeps them busy anytime of day,Positive
i love this solutions for my kids i gave it a four star rating because in order to install apps you just have to tap the icon well my two year old and five year old went tap crazy like a kangaroo on a pogo stick needless to say the ran out of room quickly i tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren t installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn t aside from this it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with i especially like the parental control features i just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed,Positive
i hope to find all my books in the electronic format,Positive

my daughter is totally enjoying her tablet recently though it is not charging correctly i will come to store to have it looked at,Positive
i purchased this tablet for my granddaughter and she just loves it so much i have to take on the week days,Positive
a lazy mans drean when it is combined with alexa if you get the harmony hub you can really impress with home automation,Positive
i was not a fan of the amazon type operating system that is on the tablet ended up taking it back because it was not what i wanted not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an android tablet,Neutral
i bought the fire because i had heard it was a good tablet so when i bought it i was wondering if it lived up to the hype it does its fast and easy to use i put netflix on it and watch series i missed only downside is that i had to register for a trial of prime,Positive
nice tablet at a very affordable price,Positive
very happy with my purchase the tablet works amazingly good for the price,Positive
grandson really enjoyed it christmas very easy to use,Positive
she s becoming part of the family but the echo plus is not much different that i have discovered yet anyway than the echo nd generation i haven t had the echo st generation and so i do not know i have had the echos plus echos nd generation and dot about weeks and the only thing i think makes the difference is that it has a better sound quality but we are talking for those really connoisseur kinds of ears or the ones that like to turn up the volume the hue lightbulbs are great i bought the echo plus on a black friday extended sale and the hue lightbulb was a real bonus further i liked it so much i went back and bought the pack of hue bulbs that were also on sale we are loving the whole system and the lightbulbs,Positive
the echo was so good i ended up getting the echo show as well at first it was a device that i enjoyed using for various reasons one being that i could ask alexa to watch any youtube videos i wanted to watch then one day i asked alexa to play a video and she responded by saying google is not supported on echo show until youtube comes back as a skill the echo show probably isn t worth the extra money i d say stick with the echo if you have amazon music or spotify or the echo dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home,Neutral
purchased this as a gift for my father and he s loving it,Positive
my son uses his tablet on a daily basis he makes sure he has his case on it and can use all the apps i can also use it and put on parental protections,Positive
i purchased this on black friday because i could pass on the price the tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on amazon if i were to purchase another android tablet i will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi tasking,Positive
the echo show is a very awesome product because of alexa itself she will answer questions you ask her play music on your demand and you can even ask her to make calls and video chats for you i also like the fact that it sounds very nice and the video quality is unlike anything i ve ever seen in a hybrid tablet product a must have for your home,Positive
great e reader easy to download books screen is easy to read from,Positive
we bought the echo show to get the hyped benefits of alexa and home automation after using for a week we decided to return the echo show alexa just isn t ready for prime time of the time we got the i can t answer that response to questions it s a waste of money for us say alexa say good bye,Neutral
purchased the echo plus and couldn t be more pleased easy to use,Positive
bought for my mom as a gift she s not tech savvy but it s easy for her to get used to definitely a good tablet for beginners,Positive
works great for my year old i don t like that it requires a pin to use it but goodidn t and strong tablet,Positive
decent camera clarity on the screen fast downloads,Positive
the kindle has come in very handy lately i always have a book to read and this is great to just grab on the go battery life is great only drawback is no backlight,Positive
easy to play and very helpful to learning for children s,Positive
i love the touch screen aspect still love the original,Positive
in my opinion it s very slow for internet use good for our yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house,Neutral
i bought this as a gift as far as know it works fine,Positive
decided to go for the model just below this one i didn t need the integrated hub features phillips hue does require this but i decided to stick with my current insteon hub,Positive
i had originally bought my son the kindle fire hdx and it worked great for him the only downfall to it was he wanted both the rear and front facing cameras but it only came with the front facing camera as children do they break things and he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year i did not want to spend that much money on the second kindle so that s why i chose this amazon fire inch tablet and it has the front and rear facing cameras and that my son wanted all the features are the same it is a great buy i would highly recommend it,Positive
i reviewed a lot of tablets before i bought this one it is the first one i have ever purchased i am no tech geek and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it i mostly bought it for and use it for reading e mail facebook and browsing the internet i really like it and use it more than my laptop but if i need to do anything detailed i use my laptop overall it s a great tablet for a beginner and you can t beat the price,Positive
the tablet is excellent very fast and well worth the money the display is great,Positive
i love alexa and my echo device and smart bulb so much i bought more echos and more bulbs with more to come soon,Positive
i love being able to turn my lights on or off by voice it makes life a lot easier i am looking forward to finish making my home a smart home by buying other products,Positive
really enjoy the echo plus this is a must have for all homes,Positive
when i first read about amazon echo show i thought the sound quality would be inferior to echo because of the small size which to me would be a deal breaker i read that the sound is actually superior to echo it is compatible with most existing security cameras so i decided to buy one then best buy ran a strong promotion if you buy so i caved and bought i have a number of echo s and echo dots in the house i am completely blown away by echo show here is a brief summary of thoughts likes substantially the best sound quality of any echo to date with stronger bass directional stereo dolby audio focused sound field to the front you can rock out louder with less sound to the sides back so you do not share your music to all as does the echo the far field microphones are more effective than echo high resolution screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen song lyrics are great free optional setting to turn on lyrics photos of the album cover the band on all music are awesome buttons on top mute camera defeat with red on screen indicator volume up volume down excellent resolution with built in camera auto presence detector turns show screen on when you are detected speak to alexa just as with echo or dot show mutes the volume shows what you asked on the screen with the music volume lowered in the background ask the forecast you get written verbal forecast you also get a second screen showing the next days including real feel a picture of the anticipated weather chance of rain etc say alexa show me the front porch or any of the numerous security cameras within seconds there is a highly detailed live video with sound video conference i do not know anyone else with show yet so i cannot try this but call yourself you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings uses the same power supply as amazon echo sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings see photo of show in the center of the desk with k monitors ipad pro the touch screen sensitivity is perfect build quality is first rate rubber feet protect any surface are anti slip addictive more than any other device this is one you will want in the center of your desk as shown in my photo because once you add the video component you will wonder how you enjoyed music sports just about everything without it see your shopping list see visual confirmation that the lights you ask alexa to turn on actually turned on dislikes none i would only offer one design option i would offer an optional amazon echo show wireless subwoofer for this beast that you could buy later it would work like the many soundbars that include a wireless sub that would allow show to not only rock out but to shake the walls at the same time i am seriously planning to sell some echos dots to pick up a couple more shows they are great,Positive
it works fast and very clear speakers sound amazing looks great in bedroom,Positive
enjoying using alexa and love the smart home features,Positive
we loved the echo dot but the show is exponentially better especially love to see the words of the songs being played and views of places all over the world we want to see big difference in cost between dot and show but worth it,Positive
great generic tablet for looking to keep kids occupied mine enjoy the freetime unlimited and the child restrictions are great for my needs my only concern has been for the space available i was amazed at how quickly they ate up gb of space on apps,Positive
what a treat what s the weather forecast what s the news this morning just about all you need to know plus smart home control,Positive

this tablet is a nice budget friendly device that is also rugged it has survived countless falls from my yr old he loves it and it keeps him learning for hours,Positive
the video screen really adds wonderfully to the functionality of the echo devices,Positive
thoughts of being able to have the echo grow as i added to the list of tasks excited me including the latest app having it to recognize my smartphone s contact list to place and to receive calls however the echo i purchased does not link up to my samsung smartphone disappointed is a understatement,Positive
i bought it for my niece who is seven years old she loves it and she learns from the applications included,Positive

i purchased the kindle light because i love to read and needed something that would not die quickly i also needed something smaller and lighter that could go anywhere with me i love my purchase and a must have for all book worms,Positive
it works well for me however my wife seems to have cold fingers and the touch screen does not always respond one other odd quirk if the tablet is turned off and you plug it in to charge it it automatically turns on you then have to wait until it boots and then turn it off again this is very annoying before recommending to someone i would tell them about this annoying quirk,Positive
i am really enjoying this device i wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping something small yet powerful and this works perfect stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there would and have recommended this product,Positive
we got this for our three year old daughter at first she was not interested it it at all she just wanted my tablet but once she got use to it she now prefers it to my ipad,Positive

was a great purchase loved the color and the camera feature,Positive
my whole family loves alexa we have the dots in all the bedrooms i love the smart home features you can add i love the music offered as a prime member and when you re bored at home she will play games with you or even read you a book,Positive
finally decided to try alexa lights heating doors etc everything is homekit compatible in my house but this one was too tempting what a great device alexa is years ahead of siri great system to have by your bed and it also controls most of my devices,Positive
less than useless does not work with amazon cloudcam i purchased this from best buy to allow me to monitor my two cloud cams from my kitchen i am very tech savvy and have numerous alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work i tried installing and enabling the amazon cloudcam skill made sure there were no new updates for the show the show automatically updated when i first plugged it in the final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can t use the show with the cloudcam and then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem useless is no help less than useless actually makes more work the echo show is less than useless,Negative
the echo show screen is great it is helpful with recipes music etc i use it to listen to music all the time i am hoping someone in my family gets one soon so we can face time each other,Positive
my wore out my is much better allthough the covers are expensive and screen protectors are hard to find the battery life is exceptional,Positive
i have had this for several weeks it works great i am very satisfied with it so far,Positive
good for alittle ones for games and movies picture not so clear but not expensive,Neutral
my daughter like her tablet it s so simple to use,Positive
this echo show comes in handy i use it almost as much as i thought i would i am still learning all that it can do but my favorite part is the screen it s not a huge deal but if i could change one thing it would be a detachable power cable instead of hardwired,Positive
easy hook up great for lights and my sony tv i use all the time,Positive
just lock the card out and let the kids go crazy,Positive
alexa in itself needs lots of improvement but with philips hue and smart plugs you can have a lot of fun settings,Positive
i replaced an older tablet with this new version all of my e books transferred to the new one and i love it,Positive

worst product ever constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove best buy refused to help when i wanted to return it,Negative
this has been awesome for my year old nephew keeps him entertained and it works great,Positive
i upgraded my kindle to the kindle voyage because i read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake i thought i would be able to use this kindle without the lamp but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable i still use the kindle with the lamp on but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room i bought the magnetic case so when i open the lid the kindle wakes up it is a little smaller than my old kindle and fits in my purse perfectly all in all i love it and would highly recommend it,Positive
it was a bit more involved getting set up but thereafter the function is simply talking to alexia the plug adapter to turn on and off lights tv is useful and certainly worth having,Negative
works great just the beginning of my plans for a smart house,Positive
i bought this because i have ebooks in college not only could i not get my ebook i called the school it department they could not either my semester was already started the sales representative at the store told me this is what i needed i ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than minutes with the schools it department help,Negative
it s an ok tablet because you need to have an amazon account in order to download free apps,Neutral
upgraded from my old kindle keyboard i love the ability to adjust brightness and font i have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand i was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use the charging cover last a long time i wish there were more colors to choose from,Positive

great tablet for reading and game play color is great,Positive
very easy to set up adding other accessories that it operates is easy as well great product,Positive

great tablet my son really likes it to read and also to play games,Positive

i didn t think i needed alexa to have a screen but now i m so glad we got this when i ask to see my grocery list it pops up on the screen also can do video calls from it really like our alexa and the dots we have them in almost every room of the house now,Positive
first bought the dot to see if we liked it we enjoyed it but wanted a little more volume when i saw that the show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice now we have the dot in the bedroom and the show in the living room for larger rooms the show is a great choice,Positive
this is my first tablet so far i am pleased with my fire tablet i am not a gamer i do basic internet searches and check e mail is easier due to size than using my smart phone no problems or issues to this point,Positive

i got this tablet so i wouldn t have to pack up my laptop when i went to my boyfriend s when i want to do my online class this is perfect for that,Positive
the show has a good picture and good sound love using it to look things up,Positive
wish the kindle fire for kids had better way to limit how many items you can download at once most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that game program which is clog download times needs a better way to remove unwanted items rather than clicking and clicking on every item speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet app store is great and has many items,Positive
amazon echo show is the best of all my amazon products i love the hands free but able to see things on the screen,Positive
this tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently the built in amazon pieces for prime members is great and work flawlessly but it s not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes they need to take a lesson or two from apple,Negative
we already have the echo in our house i got this for my son for his apartment and he loves it,Positive
i love this tablet it is very efficient and easy to use,Positive
i bought a kindle fire years ago and enjoyed using it i always wished for more storage and better connectivity this new model has both and i can use with my amazon account,Positive

this tablet was affordable and it s pretty decent,Positive
simple to use and setup for a years old toddler,Positive
i bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e reader it s actually cheaper than most of the kindles for that limited use it works fine i don t think i would want to use it as a general purpose table too slow makes a fine e reader though as for recommending this to a friend i would but would make sure they knew what i use it for,Positive
love this kindle there are to many apps and games offered for download love the book selection easy to navigate the charger seems a bit loose though,Positive
love it take it with me everywhere not all of us are computer technical savvy need better written printable instructions on how to use step step etc,Positive
waste of money ask alexa a question and you are lucky if you get an answer instead of i m not sure,Negative
its pretty good for the price my only concern is the quality of the picture not an hd one my daughter complain when shes taking pics,Positive
good product for youngsters provides learning and fun together,Positive
i bought this tablet for my daughter who was turning but also because we were taking an hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied the games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it it doesn t effect the tablet my only issue is that the charger doesn t stay secure in the charger spot sorry i don t know the technical terms haha so sometimes i will think it is charging and in fact it is not i recommend buying the warranty for issues like that,Positive

the show is the new alexa device with a video screen i like being able to see a screen when you ask questions and you can view videos too i also like that you can see the temperature and date without having to ask i like you can view a video of a recipe not just see text the one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio system i have two dots and love them the show would be perfect if i could also hook it up to my audio system even though this feature does not exist it still is a great product,Positive
gave it to my grandkids ages for christmas and they loved it,Positive
great for my year old she loves it great price and great product,Positive
i thought that this tablet was junk but it has surpassed my expectations,Positive
i had microsoft surface unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet since went back to laptop for work didn t need another surface settled on kindle hd over samsung and ipad mini due to value i only use for social networks email games internet search and occasional viewing of videos this is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection great value as i paid under during the holidays and it has been as good as my surface for these basic uses,Positive
the tap is a great concept i love my echo so a portable one was that much better however the sound is pretty terrible no bass and can be scratchy it was a good concept just poor execution,Negative

love this kindle there are to many apps and games offered for download love the book selection easy to navigate the charger seems a bit loose though,Positive
the echo show is great but it is not just plug and play the app directions are not understandable if you are having problems however the amazon hot line was very helpful but who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues all in all i am getting used to the features and like it,Positive
did not expect this kind of quality for the price i paid very surprised nice product,Positive
had a great experience with my best buy rep great job,Positive

alexa runs my entire house the echo show is a great addition to the echo family everyone needs one,Positive
adds some nice tricks to the regular echo lineup video calls to other show owners works well speakers sound good,Positive
this was a present for my son but he seems to be enjoying it so it must be ok,Positive
the store representative took his time with me to choose the right size and the lady at the check out got me hooked up with best buy program membership,Positive

my mother has dementia and this keeps her busy for periods of time she is fun to have around,Positive
after owning the kids samsung this seems confusing to navigate also they have returned to using the samaumg,Negative
i was initially going to just get the amazon kindle but i thought this gives me a tablet and a easy way to read books i buy e college texts it has helped me so much i m so happy i invested my money in this,Positive
i gave the echo stars but i like amazon products and ultimately the product is good however i use cree smart light bulbs in my house and bought this echo for the built in hub to try and eliminate the extra hub space in my house but the built in hub of the echo plus isn t compatible at this time with cree light bulbs so i had to return it and wait for now and stick with my regular echo and echo dot s,Positive
we got this mostly to read books and play some games it s a cheap tablet so no problem if it gets broken don t buy the extended warranty not worthy,Positive
it does everything amazon and i can even see who is at the front door with arlo it doesn t do netflix or hulu but that s okay i really like the sound it fills small rooms it s easy now to video chat with nana or drop in to tell my kid s goodnight when i am working late,Positive
serves my needs as required sound is good ability to move device where required is ideal,Positive
it has been a lot of fun using in our kitchen i think we use it much more than we thought we would,Positive

this is my nd tablet and it works great with downloading,Positive
bought for my eight year old she absolutely loves it,Positive
amazon s echo show has been a great help to my daily rutine from asking simple things like the weather to more specific things like flash briefings or traffic to my commute echo show is a great tool for any tech enthusiast,Positive
it was well worth the black friday price the screen is so clear it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hands easy and fast when navigating,Positive
good tablet but no youtube kids like on iphone don t expect iphone pad quality very basic appstore for children,Positive
we had the echo still do it s just in another room and purchased the show we also have a couple of dots and have them all set to communicate with each other as you walk by the show it gives mini tips news fun facts etc love it you can even use it like skype with others who have a show,Positive
decent somewhat slow netflix freezes up at times,Neutral
sound and response is good works well for area coverage,Positive
i purchased it so the weather and info can be seen on the screen at the time i never knew there was an echo spot or i would have tried that the show sounds good however i wish there was a ring or something on top that would light up like the original alexa,Positive
i needed something to read in the sunlight other than fire hd,Positive
i was a little skeptical at first about the amazon tap but after discovering how easy it was to set up i was able to connect to my music library with ease great sound and nice to have the portability to take with me,Positive
great tablet for the price we have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids this is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids,Positive
amazon kindle products have always been reliable consistent quality and this is no different very happy with it,Positive
i like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports etc still not using it to its full potential but we have it controlling a couple of lamps giving us weather reports setting timers and alarms it s making me lazy sometimes it doesn t hear my voice hears my husband s voice better i find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table,Positive
bought online for my granddaughter and she loves it i have to get one for myself after seeing the quality of the picture,Positive
for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it,Positive
i got this because it was a cheap tablet it does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also i don t like the amazon ecosystem or app store i wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones,Positive
for under this tablet is a bargain i do all i want on it like check email facebook twitter watch youtube read books and shop on ebay or amazon i ve been very pleased with my purchase,Positive
i bought this low priced kindle to test as a travel replacement for my pounds of laptop i wound up taking it on a month long trip out of the country and it was superb for email online transactions like buying theatre tix and finding and making various reservations also outstanding performance for videos and music all this for suggest you buy a usb mini cable if you buy one of these superb devices yokod,Positive
if reading is what you do the most with your tablet this is good choice,Positive
i have been transforming my house to a smart home so far thus is my favorite does so much i learn more each day,Positive
i liked the screen size and easy to read books at night the battery has a long life the outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability,Positive
only negative is the apps thought they were from android but they re an amazon version and limited,Positive
the ultimate lazy life is happening before my eyes now i love technology always have but let s be honest telling alexa to turn the lights off and on and ask her to tell you a joke as examples it really is great and i m now addicted to the hue line as well,Positive
i had to return my device due to wifi signal dropping maybe i just had a bad unit,Positive
i purchased two echo dots for black friday once i loaded my xm i found the shortcomings the volume was not load enough went back and picked this up and it filled up the room the dot was moved to the bedroom were it was load enough for the small room,Positive
this speaker s forte is it s drop and charge ability it does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with the sound quality though is ok def not very loud and lacks the lows but for a small portable speaker which is not expensive i would recommend it,Positive
ok so in order to get three working well i needed to get four but the one that needed to be returned was quite easy all is great kids love them,Positive
the parental control could be a lot better it s nice and compact she loves it,Positive
was looking at some more expensive android tablets to replace a year old device and saw this one on sale despite the relatively much lower price i was originally very worried that the amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full google play catalog but it turns out that while it is missing some important apps not just games but productivity apps too the more than adequate specs good enough screen gb of ram decent processor are enough for of what i need from a tablet and if you can get it on sale you can t go wrong lastly if you re deciding between the and this fire splurge a little bit and get this one instead,Positive
this is a good tablet for basic use i ened up returning it and going with an ipad which met my needs more this tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge use,Neutral
i got this tablet for skype calls and browsing it s good if you don t have an ample scope of tasks,Positive
nice product i like the color of the screen very clear,Positive
no complaints works great and the battery is awesome as always,Positive
my son had a nabi we bought for learning entertainment there were many games we downloaded that didnt work without internet or would shut down randomly on it but we habe yet to encounter a problem with the fire i download games and books for him to read which work just great without having to be connected to the internet,Positive
very impress with the echo show and all of its features,Positive
daughter uses it constantly for games texting web surfing and email great alternative to more expensive devices,Positive
tablet good for kids and some adults price and screen resolution were also a selling point,Positive
the kindle fire is a wonderful small device to use for a multitude of tasks we use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use so happy we chose this one it is lightweight and convenient to take with you,Positive
overall i ve been very happy with my new kindle voyage the screen is much sharper than my wife s paperwhite v and the backlight is much more even i ve also been very happy with the page turn buttons it makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right the only issue i have that keeps this from earning stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two tone hue it is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen it isn t something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader,Positive
i looked at google home and the echo i went with the echo after i spoke to a best buy employee they helped me sort out the pros and cons i do love all the skills that are possible its like another person in my apt sometimes i live alone the echo adjusts my lights and plays my pandora i m pretty much loving it,Positive
the whole family uses the echo we love the ability to use just say alexa and tell here what we want the youngest granddaughter loves the insult generator,Positive
this is so much easier to travel with than the lap top,Positive
i was against getting something in my house like this being skeptical about hackers watching thru the device however this is the greatest thing since sliced bread it can do just about everything and the sound is fantastic when steaming music being able to change the dish network channel by saying it is so convenient while hands are in the flour for ex access to information is endless and immediate with her replies we love it,Positive
this product is great and a nice addition to the echo family,Positive
this amazon echo is the coolest gadget you can buy it is very smart and learns very fast it runs many items in our home ie nest lg tv lights,Positive
i have both an amazon echo and amazon show and prefer the show with the video screen i use the show to display recipes when cooking lyrics to the music i m listening to and video conferencing with my family i like seeing headlines of stories scroll across the screen along with the t me and temperature,Positive
was recommended to me and we love it use for music timer in the kitchen great recipes and love the question of the day only have had for weeks can t wait to explore more,Positive
great selections hard to find assistance at times,Positive
works seamlessly and easy to set up and use a great product,Positive
not sure if this is due to the new version but i m not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet amazon is really trying to lock out non amazon apps namely ones from google aside from that though performance is already and what you d expect from a tablet in this price range this was purchased for my mom and it does what s needed and my mom has no complaints thus far,Positive
it is great i like it very much i can find anything you want,Positive
it s fun for the family to play with but it may get boring after the newness wears off we ll see,Positive
i love the kindle it is a great product it reduces eye strain so i enjoy reading on it this is my second kindle,Positive
i was looking for a blutooth speaker to use with my phone but i didn t want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months this speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by alexa and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound the speaker quality is great for a portable option the only thing that i don t like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right but i can t knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem,Positive
this is the second amazon fire tablet i have purchased this time in a color other than black this like the first has met all my expectations,Positive
very satisfied with tablet very fast and efficient,Positive
like the fact that i can see videos and utilize ir with my lighting system,20
alexa walks you through every step which i found helpful,20
the best tablet for kids the year unlimited apps is my favorite my kids love it,20
just installed but like it so far the picture is clear and the price is affordable,20
this kindle fire is lighter than my old one the speed is great all apps load very quickly i also like that it comes in different colors,20
this tablet does a great deal from surfing the net to watching movie and using all of the music channels this is an affordable way to stay in touch also i use it for ebooks for school,20
this was the perfect gift for grandkids i bought one in pink and one in green so each grandchild would have their own color lots of games come with the tablet and additional games and videos can be added,20
i bought this for my wife and absolutely loves it alexa is so smart and helps my wife with everything like a personal assistant,20
i just love every thing about it its awesome to read,20
video integration it s big plus for video calling kids at home and quick check who s at the door when doorbell rings,20
it is a solid product great for kids i like it a lot,20
this device meets the needs of my grandson he can read and play games on it it also has the parental safeguards,20
i like the echo show i can view my cams watch a movie and read the news the camera video is slightly delayed and i do wish it had a jack for earphones but the sound on mine is good,20
love the color just the right size easy to set up works well for what i needed it for great price,20
this tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality,20
great tablet for my yr old love the profile options and parental controls,20
this was a gift for my kids they love them easy to use and lots of great apps,20
so many things you can use it for love working my lights,20
this was a christmas present for the nephew works good he loves it,20
good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn,20
has built in smart hub unlike other echos works with other smart home devices with no additional purchases,20
replacement tablet for my wife no complaints she watches netflix on it a lot,20
this is a great product at a great price i would definitely recommend this to anybody especially good for college students or people that read books etc,20
i have of these in my house work great i just bought for christmas gifts for my family,20
good tablet but no youtube kids like on iphone don t expect iphone pad quality very basic appstore for children,20
with a price tag of this is one of the low end tablets with a lot of features but is certainly worth its price tag but it definitely lacks the features and hd display of its high end variant fire hd,20
this kindle fire blows away my other tablet for performance battery life readability color and many other options i love this size as well,20
the kindle is amazing this is my second one the price was misleading however as i had to pay something like another extra bucks to get rid of the ads just know that,20
little putsy so far but there are continuous updates that i think will make this a great device to stay connected with family bought a second for my dad who knows he might replace his land line someday if this gets better i do think our original echo is a bit better at responding but i enjoy this one in the kitchen aka hub of the house,20
this is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device,20
my kids loved it they were able to learn how to use it right away,20
this is a great tablet for kids and adults alike,20
i have the echo and a dot this is great for video calling and intercom calling in the house use it every day i run all my photo s stored on amazon prime and for music,20
great item to upgrade your house works very well,20
needs to be a stand alone device i should have not required to use a tablet of cell phone to make it work amazon needs to work on the technology on device,20
i am so glad that i bought this echo it has made it easier to automate my music and my lights throughout my house we are still learning to use it but hope to add our thermostat as well to the items i can control with my alexa,20
your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps videos and the internet you can not get a better deal the yr anything happens warranty is a big plus it s not the fastest thing on the market it s desent picture quality is great everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy love the fact that i can program it to have her read mins st before she can fully access it also that i can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week,20
great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on black friday,20
i am an old traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books now i don t lose what page i was on and have more shelf space where books used to be,20
i bought this after i bought the amazon echo this was actually an impulse buy i saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it because i enjoyed the echo so much it does everything the echo does but the sound quality is not great when you re playing at middle volume it s ok the lows are there but doesn t sound good i m guessing i m comparing it with the bose mini soundlink when you set the volume high the bass is almost non existent the mids and highs are loud with the louder volume another difference is that with tap you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands i do like the fact that it s portable because of that i m on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass,20
fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the,20
i bought two of these for two of my children the parental controls are great and i can easily control their access to content the ability to make them do something educational like read for min before playing games is awesome this tablet does everything i wanted it to do,20
very nice easy to use got it to use with amazon prime great combo,20
i love my amazon fire hd it s not too small and not too big i was looking at other tablets and decided on the amazon fire hd because of the price and because i have amazon prime i purchased it online at best buy and then picked it up at the store on black friday it is my first tablet and so i wanted to start with one that i can have fun with and i am i do have a laptop for important things,20
it was all that my grandson wanted and didn t have to search everywhere to find it,20
we returned it could not give answers to our questions even though the answers were easily found on google,20
size brightness and convenience are good the option to link with android products for messages is a little hard,20
we bought this reader to replace a fire hdx that had seemed to go wonky turns out a couple of system resets and the hdx is back to normal so i get the old one she gets the new one but i can highly recommend this reader the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent,20
we bought three including one for my year old we all love it the only complaint is the volume there is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers it doesn t bother us too much but that s why we give it stars overall a great tablet,20
easy to use wide variety of functions awesome price,20
we bought three including one for my year old we all love it the only complaint is the volume there is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers it doesn t bother us too much but that s why we give it stars overall a great tablet,20
this is my second kindle have a few more items to learn but love it easy to get around the apps,20
i can see my grandchildren when i call it is a great machine,20
i don t recommend buying this after month of buying this it won t charge or turn on,20
i bought this tablet for my year old grand daughter and she loves it we set the parental controls for her age group and now we don t have to worry about what she is doing on it we downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it and now she has her own little private movie theater it also works great with our amazon fire tv and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows this is a great buy for the money and i recommend it to everyone,20
i really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well,20
tablet is great for kids and adult use i purchased the tablet to use at school with students with disabilities the tablet holds up well holds a charge throughout the week the tablet offers games that do not require wi fi or data if you have a prime membership there are a lot of benefits when using the fire for example free apps free streaming movies music etc,20
good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn,20
works well worth the price good quality product have not had a problem,20
i love the internet tweeting and facebook no computers can complete me my kindle takes care of all my needs juju,20
it is well designed with a safe cover for kids it also come with year warranty my son loves it already,20
i bought this for my wife and absolutely loves it alexa is so smart and helps my wife with everything like a personal assistant,20
great price on a good tablet especially on black friday,20
i needed a simple tablet to use in my car on long trips bought two of these and boy do they deliver the best tablets for this price the kindle book reader is an added bonus the finishing is good my kids love it,20
this is my third one of these and this is the best one by far,20
tablet has worked without a hitch we bought it for my father who is just shy of with a couple of instructions he s been using it without further assistance,20
i love my echo show i wish you could watch movies or tc shows or you tube so hopefully they will add that soon,20
good for beginners play games take picture and recording videos old the time,20
so my old kindle stopped working recently not sure why but it would not connect to our new router so i checked with best buy and saw they had kindle on sale for which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet i especially like that i can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light so far i have read books in the past months on this kindle and it flawless,20
i love my new amazon fire tablet it s great the perfect size to fit in my purse so that i can take it with me i would definitely recommend to a friend,20
a little more complicated than my original kindle but i like it,20
i can play games surf the internet or watch movies i can check my e mail or just about do anything i can do on a regular computer i strongly recommend it,20
had the echo plus over a week and this thing is amazing great sound and easy to move around a little tricky with the set up but works great,20
already had and when these when bb had a big sale price i couldn t order it fast enough i can see my nest cameras another product make video calls to other show owners voice calls to anyone else except and a whole host of skills that are being added almost daily my only regret is not replacing my remaining echo dots when they were on sale i won t make that mistake on next big sale i also received of the other home assistants included as free bonuses for buying a couple of other things i thought that it was only fair to compare the two disregarging the video aspects of show amazon s shows and dots echos were like comparing lambourgini to a vw bug setting up these things are like the expression i heard as a kid easier than fallin of a log and not near as dangerous,20
this is an upgrade tablet from my first kindle fire that i purchased years ago love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads the great hd visuals and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred accessed by this new device love that this fire has a front and rear camer too my old fire only had a front facing camera granted this is not an ipad but i don t want or need all an ipad does and i definitely don t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool my fire tablet does everything i need or want and it costed under i am one satisfied and pleased customer,20
my yr old grand daughter loves her new tablet now she can watch mickey clubhouse whenever she wants,20
its a lot more then we expected this is a wonderful addition to our tech life,20
this is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device,20
this is my eighth kindle some others were either lost or screen damaged i bought it as a spare current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen great price also wish i d bought two,20
this works well as it was a gift and connected without issue along with the other two,20
these were ordered one for year old and then ordered second one for year old they are easy to use and age appropriate apps for each of them,20
this is a great tablet for the price amazon is doing a good job,20
my wife and i love the amazon echo plus it s very easy to control the hue lights in the house that we have set up i would recommend this to anybody we love it we also play a lot of music on it,20
i love my kindle it s perfect for reading my favorite books,20
great tablet for price display is clear enjoy books on tablet,20
amazon built upon the success of their echo i m really enjoying the convenience of the echo with the added display,20
works great i bought for the kitchen and for master bath,20
bought it on sale for christmas gift and we ll worth the money does everything needed with good functionality easy to use for those not too tech savvy,20
so many things you can use it for love working my lights,20
tablet has worked without a hitch we bought it for my father who is just shy of with a couple of instructions he s been using it without further assistance,20
the echo show is a great addition to the amazon family works just like the echo but with a screen bright vibrant display rich clear sound works great with arlo security cameras excellent smart home addition just hope google and amazon start playing nice with each other soon so youtube will work again,20
this tablet does a great deal from surfing the net to watching movie and using all of the music channels this is an affordable way to stay in touch also i use it for ebooks for school,20
the kindle fire hd has a larger screen vs and images are crisper with more vibrant colors,20
i am loving my amazon echo show it makes life easier i love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking alexa i also love being able to video call friends and family that have an echo show or the alexa app overall it is a great product,20
very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don t work very well charging port very low quality,20
quite an upgrade from the original fire the deletion of the carousel was a welcome change the new turn style approach is faster and more consice still don t know why a chime sounds also miss the ease of making notes while reading there has got to be a better way to organize books trying to figure out series trilogies etc is impossible and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that amazon won t pick up a new purchase as a book already read,20
i like the visual with this echo although i think i would have enjoyed it more if this was my first and only alexa,20
my grandson takes it on trips and he loves it it s easy to use,20
got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked cheaper than getting the screen replaced,20
we have been using our kindle fire for years and it wore out we looked at replacing it with another fire until i saw the fire the display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference,20
great tablet new to me so i have a lot to learn about it s functions,20
i had some thoughts about getting this for a year old but if you get the screen protector and a case i feel it will last a long time,20
definitely worth the money the sound is awesome,20
we bought three including one for my year old we all love it the only complaint is the volume there is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers it doesn t bother us too much but that s why we give it stars overall a great tablet,20
we love alexa love being able to watch news briefings seeing the lyrics to songs and so much more it s in our kitchen and we use it everyday,20
this is an awesome product this is the first echo product i owned and i purchased to get off i was going to split with a friend but like this so much that i decided to keep both i ve being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos the videos on youtube takes a more effort to find the ones i want but i think this will improve over time,20
i purchased of these fire hd tablets as gifts they pack a lot of punch for the price i helped set them up so i was able to get an idea of how they are going to work the screen was very nice and clear speed of tablet was good it is easy to use if you are already in the amazon family through prime it is a no brainer i don t believe you can get a better tablet at this price point,20
great for reading best part is its light weight and long battery life,20
just installed but like it so far the picture is clear and the price is affordable,20
i bought this as a gift for my grandkids they absolutely love it,20
fantastic tablet fire one is great small and portable,20
i thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm i think it is too small to read on it not very comfortable as regular kindle would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead,20
i wanted a speaker to listen to pandora and go so much more being able to speak to alexa and get news weather timer light controls and so much more love the product,20
this little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming my kids have quickly learned that alexa is their personal dj when hooked up to the amazon prime unlimited music program battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass but it does the job for our family,20
love everything about my new tablet good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails,20
we have bought two taps one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son we love the portability of the tap it s perfect for our deck our grandchildren love it too,20
very kid friendly especially for toddlers and easy to use,20
my wife loves this tablet much easier to use than previous tablets that we purchased,20
great tablet for the price we have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids this is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids,20
it great just a little small then what i would like it have been,20
alexa is amazing and the phillips bulb works seamlessly with it,20
easy to use and great selection of books movies and games,20
echo show not only plays your music it puts up the lyrics to read from,20
bought this tablet for my grandson and we couldn t be happier he loves it and it is easy to use created the children s account so he wouldn t be distracted by all the other goings on the internet bought this so he could play games do his school work as it links up nicely to the ixl and google class love the usage timer and the ability to lock it down i have loaded the google play store on it so we now access to many games and other apps no issues so far great buy for the money only down side i can see or in this case hear so far low sounding speaker could be a bit louder or better placed all in all you wont be disappointed in this purchase great for web page looks ups reading and playing games,20
great screen resolution and easy to use battery life is really good,20
great product i m at the beginning stages of having a smart home and this was the perfect addition,20
i m normally an apple snob but needed a cheap tablet and was very surprised how functional the amazon fire is,20
love how user friendly the kindle fire is for any age,20
i bought the kindle oasis for my wife as a th anniversary gift she enjoys reading and i thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice she tried it for a few days and didn t care for it she writes notes in the margins and wasn t happy with the way the kindle did its notes for just reading i think it would be a very nice product,20
i found the amazon fire hd to be very easy to travel back and forth to school i can easily transfer my work in class to my main computer at home,20
my year old love to watch movies and this is perfect for him,20
durable worth every penny got it for our year old daughter amazed how easily she can navigate it,20
i have dots and an echo and this just sounds better and looks better,20
great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on black friday,20
this tablet has beautiful color graphics and is super thin easy to carry with you,20
added screen a great features visual effect a plus,20
i have of these in my house work great i just bought for christmas gifts for my family,20
with the cover attached the battery lasts for a good long period with the cover detached which is how i use it primarily the oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand the ability to switch hands flip upside down means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book and it fits into my pants pocket again perfect for traveling the battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days but i tend to reconnect the cover at night i am assuming that helps to recharge the basic oasis battery regardless it was well worth replacing our older kindle readers with the newer oasis we bought two,20
i love my amazon fire tablet i m sure my kids will love theirs too,20
got it for my dad easy to use and he loves it good stepping stone for future producs,20
the family and i love alexa view and once we got it we were hooked now everything in the house and outside is run by voice commands the opportunities with this are endless,20
i wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format the fire meets my needs at a great price,20
my first ebook reader read some reviews decided to go with this because of the backlight and adaptive light sometimes i have to adjust the light manually but no biggie quick and easy on the eyes,20
i bought this as a gift for my son and i know he will love it he has the old kindle fire as likes it a lot,20
i love to use alexa to listen to music set timer alarms and ect my parents use the show to show the cameras and stuff for a second control panel to their security system,20
i am totally addicted easy to use love the call feature,20
i love the echo alexa is awesome it was a christmas present also received two dots to place in other rooms,20
can use many differents apps from the echo show awesome product,20
i bought this as a gift for my husband and he is constantly asking alexa questions about everything we love listening to music on it as well,20
i have an lg tablet but picked up this one for my dad and after messing with it for a while it s very nice i think i like it more the my lg g pad,20
i m loving this new fire mainly because i didn t fork out a couple hundred for it my only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an ipad so don t look great on this,20
the kids love it they ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer i really like for the music aspect just tell it a song and it finds it,20
i bought the kindle oasis for my wife as a th anniversary gift she enjoys reading and i thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice she tried it for a few days and didn t care for it she writes notes in the margins and wasn t happy with the way the kindle did its notes for just reading i think it would be a very nice product,20

the echo plus is a fantastically easy to use smarthome hub it is easy to setup fast and responsive has a ton of capabilities that are expanding daily and looks and sounds great i currently use mine to manage my smart things like light bulbs lamps smart switches and even my robot vac it has made automating a lot of what i do daily a breeze and has simplified my life where i didn t know it needed to be simplified definitely worth the extra money to go with the plus over the echo or the dot,20
this tablet is great for trips just make sure you download games and shows on it first since it does not have internet the case is great for kids who are rough with technology it really takes a beating,20
i purchased this for my father in law and it works perfect for him good product for the price,20
we the concept to learn and adapt to the ever changing word this product should stand out,20
very easy to use and navigate my and year old grandsons can use them with ease some apps are limited as you do not have google play but there is plenty of games and learning games available,20
a great new amazon device to add to my other alexa products the visuals are amazing and it is so easy to use and set up,20
bought it for my son wife they love it both thought they didn t need it they find that it is a lot of fun and very useful,20
alexa has changed my life i now own alexas o,20

i bought this as a gift for my daughter s nd birthday and she totally loved it now she s wanting me to buy a second one so that i can keep it on the first floor she says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other i think it was a great purchase so i think i m going to have to buy another one,20
makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that i can see a whole page at one time the protective cover that best buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the on off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that i had to find another cover from another source,20
kindle products are fantastic i ve used a kindle now have a kindle fire use it everyday so naturally i would select a kindle for my granddaughter,20
so many things you can use it for love working my lights,20

love the amazon alexa products i have show echo dots and the tap wish the tap had the drop in feature the tap does make a sound when you have the hands free enabled and say alexa instead of the blue lights on the other products great for taking outside,20
the display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good probably better for reading than watching videos we didn t really get it for the games but there is a good selection wifi works well and internet browsing is fast,20
the ultimate bluetooth speaker i have multiple amazon echos and a whole echo system set up in my house i love everything amazon i can t stand apple but now i know how they feel i am a cult member of amazon lol so anyway i have been trashing this device the tap because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things i like most about the echo the only flaw of the echo is it is not portable i tried the triby but i did not like it more for little kids so on black friday the amazon tap was on super sale so i bought it the tap is smaller than i thought it was about rd the size of the echo which is perfect for portability but don t let the size fool you the sound is only short of bose when it comes to volume and sound quality important note you don t have to have an echo to use this device just the alexa app on your smart phone the tap does everything the echo does it is an amazing bluetooth speaker and it s portable automatically switches remembers different wifi areas and can be used with a hot spot the most amazing thing about the whole amazon echo system is that amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does some things even better than google now and light years ahead of siri the tap is my new favorite device it is perfect the only flaw is that it is not waterproof amazon if you are listening make the next tap waterproof,20

great speaker and echo substitute this is great for on the go as a bluetooth speaker and when connected to the internet it works great using the alexa app,20
i like my show but i can t say i love it for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices it has probably the worst microphone getting it to respond is frustrating at times where i have no problem with a standard echo besides this it all works as advertised i d wait for the second generation i m sure they can work the kinks out,20
great tablet new to me so i have a lot to learn about it s functions,20
this is an upgrade tablet from my first kindle fire that i purchased years ago love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads the great hd visuals and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred accessed by this new device love that this fire has a front and rear camer too my old fire only had a front facing camera granted this is not an ipad but i don t want or need all an ipad does and i definitely don t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool my fire tablet does everything i need or want and it costed under i am one satisfied and pleased customer,20
i love this tablet i got one for each one of the kids all different ages and they all love it,20
we bought three including one for my year old we all love it the only complaint is the volume there is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers it doesn t bother us too much but that s why we give it stars overall a great tablet,20

for the money you will be well pleased i think it is a big bargain,20
it s alright to browse the internet and watch videos,20
when it works it s great but for some reason it doesn t always answer me when it doesn t answer me i turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn t work at that time it was easy to set up with the phone app doesn t seem to matter where the phone is when it isn t working i ve tried close and far and in between so a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn t,20
i bought this second kindle for the larger storage space and love all the extra stuff i can do now,20
this has been a very nice addition it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it,20
i purchased this kindle for my wife because her kindle fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the fire since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus the main drawback is that the graphics aren t as clear with this reader all in all it was money well spent,20

amazon built upon the success of their echo i m really enjoying the convenience of the echo with the added display,20
they make it seem like you can pretty much ask anything to alexa but she never knows anything it is very non responsive at times too,20
got it for few weeks but it kind of fades away from your life,20
the echo show is a great addition to the amazon family works just like the echo but with a screen bright vibrant display rich clear sound works great with arlo security cameras excellent smart home addition just hope google and amazon start playing nice with each other soon so youtube will work again,20

speaker is pretty loud and i love that i can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the home button to use alexa,20
our whole family loves and uses this device for so many different features we love using it to make phone calls watch films play jeopardy even to define words as they come up in conversation we definitely get a lot of use out of this device more than any other screen tablet or smart phone device we own,20

i love being able to use alexa she is an amazing ai until the robots rebel against the human kind i think it s worth it,20
my nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift kindle suits it well for him to learn and study,20
the kindle is great for just reading books and the battery power is pretty good the experimental browser is not very user friendly,20
the kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu,20
i bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips,20
bought this for my daughter to use in school she loves it product works great i also bought the older version for my mom and she lives it as well,20
the echo show feels useless after a few hours especially without the ability to watch youtube,20
great tablet for the price we have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids this is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids,20
so many things you can use it for love working my lights,20
is good for the kids the only thing is i have to get a sd card for more memory,20
great tablet and price ordering online easy not happy took so long to receive though,20
good small tablet for all purposes for reading playing games,20
i love amazon products easy to use and install i recommend them very good sound and above all price,20
great value just the right size and weight suits my needs perfectly performs very well easy to get accessories to fit,20
replaced my hd fire because broke screed very pleased with the large screen,20
it s ok but i rather have bought samsung galaxy tab,20
works well we had one of the original fires and it finally died which is why we bought another great clarity and better internet also,20
through all of my research this was the best value for what i was looking for in an e reader with additional options i was not sure i would use or not turns i do because of the ease of usage,20
i purchased a echo for home so added a tap for my office at work so i can chat with alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent bt speaker for my office this has great sound streaming my prime music and xm vis the xm app can t go wrong quality music and alexa when i need some help with spelling hard word s she getting smart pick one up you have a woman to talk to when the wife is out,20
used it and looks very paper like they integrated the simplest form of an e reader which makes it stand out for its use,20
my echo show is my christmas gift to myself so far i am having great fun with this nifty new addition to my amazon family of home monitoring devices i have connected the show to my ring doorbell,20
great screen resolution and easy to use battery life is really good,20
i bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently she loves it and uses it all the time,20
i can play games surf the internet or watch movies i can check my e mail or just about do anything i can do on a regular computer i strongly recommend it,20
my niece and nephew are going to love this i got it for a great price too what a nice christmas present,20
really enjoy this product love watching movies and playing games on my fire hd,20
love this tablet it does everything i need it to my problem is i have family that falls in love with it so i give mine away if this wasn t good i wouldn t be on my rd one the only thing i would change is the silly ads and even worse browser other than that a solid product,20
the echo show is a great addition to the amazon family works just like the echo but with a screen bright vibrant display rich clear sound works great with arlo security cameras excellent smart home addition just hope google and amazon start playing nice with each other soon so youtube will work again,20
easy to set up plus the screen is very clear and easy to view,20
this tablet is great and easy to use very convenient and handy to have around,20
its a great product but for the cost the speakers are not what they should be and the screen is too small choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot i am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance,20
works better than the amazon fire tablet i have better screen faster processor and bigger to boot,20
exactly what i was looking for size wise and functional,20
easy to use love the color and my daughter loves it easy to set up very happy with my purchase,20
i bought it for my son in laws birthday after they bought me one for christmas not just good for music but helpful for grandkids homework and now we can video chat with grandkids which the one year old loves,20
awesome product and cool design and a great color i would recommend to a friend,20
purchased this for my mother for her birthday she loves it the large screen is what she wanted most,20
makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that i can see a whole page at one time the protective cover that best buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the on off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that i had to find another cover from another source,20
my son loves his new tablet now he can play his games without making a mess of my phone,20
great for reading best part is its light weight and long battery life,20
bought this to carry around for internet and gaming so far very happy,20
good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn,20
i debated on what tablet reader to buy and decided on the fire i have been very pleased with it bought it on sale what a great price,20
this is my third kindle the best differentiator is the form factor definite improvement over the paperwhite also like having the page turn buttons back case is very cool indeed if you can get past the jump in price remember you re not having to buy the case separately it s a quality product to have,20
it has very limited use without adding on expensive apps or adding more wireless speakers i am considering returning the merchandise,20
i have had kindles over the years got to have one to read my books relax,20
my son really enjoys this its his first tablet he is and had no problem learning how to use it,20
my children love these kindles they are so much better then the st ones we had the price is better as well,20
for the money you will be well pleased i think it is a big bargain,20
once taking time to install google play store it functioned as good as any other android tablet the down side is camera which doesn t produce clear pictures,20
i like it i use it everyday and so far no cons im very please,20
this was purchased for my older grandson age for christmas and as i stated in another review it has had games downloaded on it and will be ready to use when it is opened by him,20
bought this for my teenage daughter and it works beautifully with great battery life,20
this is the main reason why i went with amazon s echo ecosystem vs google home i bought one as a gift to my sister so i can easily videochat with my family my niece and nephew tend to fight over the echo show when they want to sing along to their favorite songs with the lyrics on the screen my only wish was that there was an hdmi out to connect it to a larger monitor huge missed opportunity in my opinion,20
purchased for my mom in a memory care center she doesn t have to answer the phone we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us picture clarity awesome staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently doesn t replace room camera but good would give a but can t figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her anyone know,20
so my month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet however my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my ipad but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys which makes the kindle fire tablet for kids the best invention since the tivo all the pre loaded apps videos books etc is nothing short of amazing the case is also very cool hardwood floor and stair case proof for under bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine,20
its a great product but for the cost the speakers are not what they should be and the screen is too small choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot i am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance,20
i love this tablet for kids it s so much fun for them great buy,20
i got oasis yesterday very lighweight compared to voyager screen size comparable like having actual page turn button touchscreen seems kinda slow the on off button on top is improvement from back of voyager cover does seem kind of flimsy but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up finding it easier to hold with cover on then removed cover doesn t have separate charge port so all charging is done thru kindle,20
amazon echo products are terrific and and quite helpful imagine taking the alexa voice and adding some video to it really cool great for the kitchen where you can use it for recipes as well as music and other things,20
great value just the right size and weight suits my needs perfectly performs very well easy to get accessories to fit,20
makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that i can see a whole page at one time the protective cover that best buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the on off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that i had to find another cover from another source,20
i never used kindle before my wife gifted me on my birthday this is the amazing product i am using it for daily reading the display is fantastic and no strain on eyes,20
the best tablet for kids the year unlimited apps is my favorite my kids love it,20
overall it is a good tablet but i am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and amazon app store,20
i have really enjoyed learning about the product and its many uses i thought initially music but now to get weather updates news receipies sports scores and ordering kitchen supplies,20
simply love it it s loud love watching videos,20
great tablet for the price we have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids this is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids,20
i personally love this because i can bring it every where i go and sing and its fun,20
quite an upgrade from the original fire the deletion of the carousel was a welcome change the new turn style approach is faster and more consice still don t know why a chime sounds also miss the ease of making notes while reading there has got to be a better way to organize books trying to figure out series trilogies etc is impossible and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that amazon won t pick up a new purchase as a book already read,20
this is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading,20
very kid friendly especially for toddlers and easy to use,20
i got the first version for my sister and she hasn t been able to put it down on over a year then i got her this one and forget about it great new features she loves loves loves it,20
took some time to get use to the kindle reader use to the ipad but i like that i can read without distractions,20
we love alexa love being able to watch news briefings seeing the lyrics to songs and so much more it s in our kitchen and we use it everyday,20
this is a great tablet for kids and adults alike,20
very handy to get the morning news as well as asking him to play music,20
it can stream music really well and not just from amazon i was expecting it to be smart like watson but it is more like an blank stare amazon should look into predicting questions like during superbowl play offs alexa was unable to display or update the play off brackets it understands my voice really well were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what i am saying it want pair to my portable bluetooth speaker it will pair to my cell phone but only to receive music from it the audio quality is varies with amplitude with low amplitudes alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room but an amplitude setting of about the audio becomes clear and understandable i really like playing games like jeopardy with alexa no climbing through the closet to find a box anymore and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing,20
this tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children,20
my kids loved it they were able to learn how to use it right away,20
great for reading best part is its light weight and long battery life,20
convenient easy to use and grand kids all have one too,20
setting up the amazon show was a little tricky but i managed to navigate through it it s so cool to add compatible equipment,20
i have really enjoyed learning about the product and its many uses i thought initially music but now to get weather updates news receipies sports scores and ordering kitchen supplies,20
i love to use alexa to listen to music set timer alarms and ect my parents use the show to show the cameras and stuff for a second control panel to their security system,20
got this as a gift for my sister and her fianc and they love it works great with phillips hue,20
i bought two of these one for my son and the other for nephew they love it i downloaded kidsmode on it and all their educational games they can play besides regular games,20
this is not like other android tablets in a bad way,20
bought this for my daughter to use in school she loves it product works great i also bought the older version for my mom and she lives it as well,20
we the concept to learn and adapt to the ever changing word this product should stand out,20
i like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k,20
i have the echo and a dot this is great for video calling and intercom calling in the house use it every day i run all my photo s stored on amazon prime and for music,20
i didn t think i would like the echo show especially at the price point but i tried it and love it if i could afford it and if they would add an audio port i would replace my current alexas with echo shows,20
i talk myself into the g and i am so glad i did i have used only kindles for the past years and i love them i love the color as well,20
highly impressed with my purchase allows me to use my ipad again since my years old granddaughter finally has her own tablet great support and numerous educational apps for children,20
love it works great one in each of the main rooms,20
needs to be a stand alone device i should have not required to use a tablet of cell phone to make it work amazon needs to work on the technology on device,20
alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated,20
great product i will recommend this to all of my family and friends,20
this readeri is compact and fits nicely in my bag easy to use controls for children are very effective am glad i bought it,20
other similar devices do not have the voice recognition learning capability the echo plus has it is superior to all the others,20
i picked this up after purchasing an echo i wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my echo i use both devices mostly for music it s great to be able to hear pandora or my amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone laptop etc i can just grab the tap and go anywhere in my house outside to the deck anywhere that i my wireless will reach,20
this is my second kindle have a few more items to learn but love it easy to get around the apps,20
it worked really well for me as i am unschooled in ipads i used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things i needed i e maps books downloaded internet access youtube etc i don t play games so cannot comment on that,20
this is a great tablet for the price amazon is doing a good job,20
bought this for my grandson the first one had issues and best buy exchanged it my grandson loves it,20
i am using it for my year old and she loves it,20
kid friendly great appschild can learn many things with this tablet,20
my kids loved it they were able to learn how to use it right away,20
i love this tablet i got one for each one of the kids all different ages and they all love it,20
nicer than my old fire better screen area to view,20
she hasn t used the it yet but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine,20
it great just a little small then what i would like it have been,20
the tablet with an added protective case has so far held up better than other tablets i have tried and the parental controls are great i can also add educational apps that i want,20
awseome tablet for kids i would recommend this tablet for all age groups,20
exactly what i was looking for size wise and functional,20
the show is our new best friend we watch shows on it everyday at lunch time and we end every night saying alexa turn off screen,20
great for reading best part is its light weight and long battery life,20
my son loves his new tablet now he can play his games without making a mess of my phone,20
i had my doubts when i first purchased it but after just a day i had synced it with my thermostat lights tv bose sound system and many more amazing product couldn t be happier,20
set up was simple we liked so much we bought one for my mom,20
little putsy so far but there are continuous updates that i think will make this a great device to stay connected with family bought a second for my dad who knows he might replace his land line someday if this gets better i do think our original echo is a bit better at responding but i enjoy this one in the kitchen aka hub of the house,20
i bought my step mom an updated kindle she reads the new kindle more than her old one,20
i like this ereader it is a little small but you can increase the font,20
i love the cameras and the video capabilities i have set up the picture albums and can even share on facebook and messenger i like the side charger much better than front i love the size too,20
easy to set up but it does not work with all phones i have samsung,20
this tablet is perfect for travel recently took it on a trip and the battery lasted the entire day with watching shows on and off on netflix great first tablet,20
i bought this as a gift so i haven t gotten to use it much yet the initial setup was really easy and i am sure that she is going to love it,20
i like the visual with this echo although i think i would have enjoyed it more if this was my first and only alexa,20
she is alexa better younger sister love her and some of the new skills great,20
great tablet for my yr old love the profile options and parental controls,20
the new tablet is great nice upgrades love how easy it is to use easy to get apps shop and browse the web,20
makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that i can see a whole page at one time the protective cover that best buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the on off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that i had to find another cover from another source,20
the ultimate bluetooth speaker i have multiple amazon echos and a whole echo system set up in my house i love everything amazon i can t stand apple but now i know how they feel i am a cult member of amazon lol so anyway i have been trashing this device the tap because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things i like most about the echo the only flaw of the echo is it is not portable i tried the triby but i did not like it more for little kids so on black friday the amazon tap was on super sale so i bought it the tap is smaller than i thought it was about rd the size of the echo which is perfect for portability but don t let the size fool you the sound is only short of bose when it comes to volume and sound quality important note you don t have to have an echo to use this device just the alexa app on your smart phone the tap does everything the echo does it is an amazing bluetooth speaker and it s portable automatically switches remembers different wifi areas and can be used with a hot spot the most amazing thing about the whole amazon echo system is that amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does some things even better than google now and light years ahead of siri the tap is my new favorite device it is perfect the only flaw is that it is not waterproof amazon if you are listening make the next tap waterproof,20
when it works it s great but for some reason it doesn t always answer me when it doesn t answer me i turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn t work at that time it was easy to set up with the phone app doesn t seem to matter where the phone is when it isn t working i ve tried close and far and in between so a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn t,20
easy to use love the color and my daughter loves it easy to set up very happy with my purchase,20
we bought this as a christmas gift for our year old he loves it it s durable and reliable,20
this is my third kindle second fire i use it constantly primarily for reading electronic books currently have over books in kindle library like it best when traveling as i don t have to carry a bunch of hardback books with me anywhere i go where i know there will be a waiting line haircut doctor s or dentist s office i have it with me and use it productively to read,20
the color is what got me and the features was on point the screen shows a lot of different displays to share for now until the next one,20
this product is easy to use and take along with you,20
in my opinion this model is too small and feels cheap and sd card slot,20
looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened,20
makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that i can see a whole page at one time the protective cover that best buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the on off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that i had to find another cover from another source,20
it was all that my grandson wanted and didn t have to search everywhere to find it,20
we use alexa for so many things we use it for shopping list music lights on or off even trivia games,20
this is a great tablet for kids as it is not too expensive and there is a year warranty if it breaks within years they replace it my year is very rough with things my husband was letting him plug the charger in by himself and jammed it into the tablet causing the charging port to break i had no problems getting it replaced,20
using it in my kitchen the whole family has access and we can all use different functionality great for looking up recipies music and calling relatives or friends,20
i am so glad that i bought this echo it has made it easier to automate my music and my lights throughout my house we are still learning to use it but hope to add our thermostat as well to the items i can control with my alexa,20
bought if for my year old son has plenty of space long battery life it s durable and hasn t broke when dropped i m going to buy a case though,20
got this tablet for my year old son and he can not put it down it is so much to do so many learning games i love this product,20
using the kindle to read books and stream videos is very easy and enjoyable,20
this is a great tablet for kids and adults alike,20
not a substitute for an ipad but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage,20
i brought my tube amplifier to best buy and my magnolia rep hooked it up to a pair of b w series speakers wow it sounded like etta james was right in the room fantastic,20
upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras sound is much better,20
needed a new kindle wasn t sure what one to choose this one is great,20
a great new amazon device to add to my other alexa products the visuals are amazing and it is so easy to use and set up,20
fits easily into my purse or bag small compact,20
the kindle fire hd has a larger screen vs and images are crisper with more vibrant colors,20
i was hesitant and i am now hooked this is both fun and useful,20
i brought my tube amplifier to best buy and my magnolia rep hooked it up to a pair of b w series speakers wow it sounded like etta james was right in the room fantastic,20
so many things you can use it for love working my lights,20

easy to use and great selection of books movies and games,20
got this on sale for replaces my cds must buy as long as you have prime,20
i received an original echo two years ago and use it in my office this year i decided to get one for the house and was amazed at all the features i hadn t taken advantage of primarily the smart home features this was great because it came with a lightbulb,20
my wife and i love the amazon echo plus it s very easy to control the hue lights in the house that we have set up i would recommend this to anybody we love it we also play a lot of music on it,20
this little sorcerer s box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors,20
replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon with electronics in the cabin under scrutiny this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill perfect in small purses and large pockets i can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you re holding it,20
i enjoy alexa she reminds me of appointment and alerts me when my packages arrive,20
was recommended to purchase by a family member who has one who is very happy with it,20
it has been wonderful i bought it for my boyfriend but i get more use out of it then he does,20
i m loving this new fire mainly because i didn t fork out a couple hundred for it my only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an ipad so don t look great on this,20
the kindle is amazing this is my second one the price was misleading however as i had to pay something like another extra bucks to get rid of the ads just know that,20
this is the best assistant from amazon with the completion of the screen you can also see images from cameras and other devices simply awesome,20
bought for our son so he wouldn t have to carry books back from his deployment,20
purchased for my mom in a memory care center she doesn t have to answer the phone we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us picture clarity awesome staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently doesn t replace room camera but good would give a but can t figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her anyone know,20
the kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu,20
outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced ipad,20
love my kendal but cannot find a case or screen saver for it,20
i love that this tablet came preloaded all we needed to do was charge it and my child had access to many books at an appropriate level,20
my son is a huge fan of it and i love that i can control what he watches and plays,20
got it as a gift for my dad so far so good didn t not realise the special offers are ads spend more money to buy the one with out them also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection you now need wifi to connect to the store,20
i like the visual with this echo although i think i would have enjoyed it more if this was my first and only alexa,20
very nice easy to use got it to use with amazon prime great combo,20
haven t been able to train alexa like we ve heard probably our own fault we have fun with it,20
with this you can make calls to other echo shows or using the app you can call others that have the a show i haven t used this feature yet since i m the only one i know who has one i can tell you that while using the app at home or away from home off the network you can call the show i did this while at work to check it out and caught my son coming in the back door i freaked him out but after he settled down we chatted via video chat for awhile and both agreed it was awesome you could also just drop into the show from the app to check on the house or whatever wherever you have it keep in mind you re only gonna see what it s pointed at the camera doesn t move plus in its natural form it is tilted back slightly so it point upward there are stands on amazon the correct the tilt to make it straight up and down almost forgot but the speakers are amazing you can link multiple echos together to play music i have the show in my living room an echo in my bedroom and the dot connected to a jbl speaker in another room after set up through the app i can tell alexa to play music and they all come to life,20
excellent for what you pay and always good shopping at bestbuy,20
perfect start for smart home works perfect with echo,20
we have always been nexus tablet desciples and in fact have bought of them for self and family members this one was for granddaughter to replace nexus that had gotten slow this one works better faster than the nexus it s fast easy to use perfect tablet for a child or teenager and can t beat the price very pleased with purchase,20
got this for my year old daughter and her and my three year old love it lightweight durable and loaded with books and games what really sold me on this one over the other options was the year anything guarantee that amazon offers,20
i loved the amazon echo but to be able to see so much more on the screen is amazing i highly recommend,20
i bought this for my grandson and it hasn t disappointed me at all he loves his tablet i am looking at buying his sister one next,20
great item would definitely recommend this item am still learning all the things about it,20
not sure why but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it very disappointing,20
great product for when you are on the go great sound,20
got this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves that it is very convenient and easy to use,20
great choice battery life outstanding many kid friendly features,20
this tablet is on the smaller side but works for me,20
i bought this for reading listening books love the availability to expand the memory now i can load movies and tons of books,20
this is a great tablet for the price amazon is doing a good job,20
i like this ereader it is a little small but you can increase the font,20
the amazon fire hd is one of the best deals on the market i ve had a ipad and would rather have the hd it s what of the price of a ipad and just as good if not better,20
we love kindle fire we purchase it for an older couple and it s easy to work,20
my son is and loves it it s very easy to use,20
i talk myself into the g and i am so glad i did i have used only kindles for the past years and i love them i love the color as well,20
super easy to setup for the kids to use parental controls are a bonus,20
i gave my paperwhite to a friend and bought the voyage i like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages i don t know that it s really worth all of the extra cost compared to the paperwhite especially since the new one just came out with dpi,20
my yr old grand daughter loves her new tablet now she can watch mickey clubhouse whenever she wants,20
alexa with screen love it works perfectly with my ring doorbell,20
we own an ipad samsug tablets and we have both love are fire s wave better,20
my kid love this tablet the setup was so easy and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps that my kid can enjoy playing and learning,20
i thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm i think it is too small to read on it not very comfortable as regular kindle would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead,20
bought this for a gift for some one who s old tablet won t work just the right size to play games on,20
this little sorcerer s box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors,20
exchanged the google google home for this model fun for the kids finding new uses for it every day had a problem when best buy forgot to include the free light bulb,20
it works about of the time when asking it a question,20
if you like to control smart gadgets this is definitely for you,20
bought for my husband for christmas we keep it in our kitchen and mainly just use it for music but our kids love that they can tell alexa to play a song they like and it plays,20
we bought this reader to replace a fire hdx that had seemed to go wonky turns out a couple of system resets and the hdx is back to normal so i get the old one she gets the new one but i can highly recommend this reader the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent,20
i love this product and it was one of my best buy s from best buy,20
bought this as a surprise gift and the recipient loves it,20
great item to upgrade your house works very well,20
i was hesitant and i am now hooked this is both fun and useful,20
limited apps and a bit thicker than ipad but works,20
better than nook also cheaper if toy areally looking to use as a tablet not the best choice great for reading and basic searching,20
alexa is now a family member how have i lived my life without her i have no idea,20
very nice easy to use got it to use with amazon prime great combo,20
purchased this for my wife during christmas and got a great deal on it compared to the older version that she has this model is faster brighter and more convenient with alexa i would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it,20
size brightness and convenience are good the option to link with android products for messages is a little hard,20
it has very limited use without adding on expensive apps or adding more wireless speakers i am considering returning the merchandise,20
it s nice to be able to listen to music in the morning and setting reminders is extremely helpful and i love being able to operate my light bulb remotely,20
i purchased these tablets for my grandchildren after purchasing for another grandchild in october they love them and their parents love being able to dictate how they use them,20
we use alexa for so many things we use it for shopping list music lights on or off even trivia games,20
when used with amazon prime and the freetime app for kids this is a great tablet recommend installing at least gb of micro sd card storage and install apps to the card to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos easy enough to use for our year old grandson,20
alexa is amazing and the phillips bulb works seamlessly with it,20
really enjoy this product love watching movies and playing games on my fire hd,20
i like my show but i can t say i love it for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices it has probably the worst microphone getting it to respond is frustrating at times where i have no problem with a standard echo besides this it all works as advertised i d wait for the second generation i m sure they can work the kinks out,20
this is a fantastic item the person i bought it for loves it,20
like the fact that i can see videos and utilize ir with my lighting system,20
having fun with all the things we can learn from alexa it is almost like having another person in the house,20
got it to gift to my friend absolutely loved it good value,20
purchased for my grandson he loves it when setting up be sure to update the software,20
the amazon echo show is so much fun i got it for my husband for christmas and its absolutely more of a gift for myself we also got hue lights and have set it up our routines this show is so much fun we listen to the news in the morning while making coffee it wakes us up with slowly with the hue lights we listen to music while cooking dinner cant recommend it more because of this purchase i am also buying a spot we love the camera feature where you can drop in so we will continue buying these rather than the security cameras for the inside at least where we just want to say hello or see our dog,20
i didn t know what i was missing out on until i got an echo plus,20
bought this kindle for my grandson he loves it and it very easy to use,20
i ve enjoyed using my fire hd tablet to play games,20
excellent for what you pay and always good shopping at bestbuy,20
purchased for an year old that wanted this badly appears to be rugged links up with my amazon account for content and access year warranty win,20
i bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips,20
my nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift kindle suits it well for him to learn and study,20
bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it it s so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls,20
you have the ability to set up on and off times for your child s profile the apps are good and adults can use it as well because you can have multiple password protected profiles on the tablet at once this was perfect for my five year old on a five thousand mile plus plane trip,20
i use it for everything mainly as my new alarm clock cant wait for them to open it up even more,20
ok so when i got this tablet i was not expecting to much from it but now that i have used it its amazing pros their is no lag at all when play high graphic games pretty easy to use very fast speedcons in my opinion their is only things that drive me insane the screen feels like plastic very uncomfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photos overall get this tablet better deal then the galaxy tab s,20
i am loving my amazon echo show it makes life easier i love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking alexa i also love being able to video call friends and family that have an echo show or the alexa app overall it is a great product,20
great product i will recommend this to all of my family and friends,20
my son loves his new tablet now he can play his games without making a mess of my phone,20
the only thing i have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device why is that,20
i have had kindles over the years got to have one to read my books relax,20
i purchased this product because i love to read and buying books got costly with this product i can read all i want for a month,20
we gave this tablet to our nine year old grandaughter for her birthday she loves it and we feel it is very sturdy that is a very good thing when it comes to tablets and children,20
bought this mostly as a backup and to read a few books since i have a larger cell phone and a back up used it occasionally may or hours of use till this week when i sent my laptop in for repairs so i probably used it a tot this week i was watching my rd primetime video this week and it simply turned off it will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode it is gone it is toast bought it october it quit on february my old fire lasted or years with more use it had stereo speakers lasted a week on a charge not or days sturdier built this is full of junk i am not just offered more apps it is constantly trying to add them junk junk junk,20
it was good works pretty easily the camera is good,20
nice easy to use tablet we just got it and so far so good,20
i can play games surf the internet or watch movies i can check my e mail or just about do anything i can do on a regular computer i strongly recommend it,20
amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up,20
i use it mainly for reading e books and browsing however i wished there were more apps available also before unlocking the tablet ads are shown in the lockscreen if the tab is locked it stops streaming the ads you can pay to disable the ads permanently i only recommend this for basic use if you want to use it for games or other apps i would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy,20
i absolutely love my kindle i go nowhere without it it has kept me entertained for hours don t have to keep up with books that get torn or lost i would and do recommend a kindle for everyone,20
great product absolute love it alexa is fun to converse with and has a wealth of information,20
got one for my mom in order to video chat with her works awesome,20
this is my first tablet love it actually read my first e book on it large screen easy to read play games fits nicely in my purse,20
outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced ipad,20
i previously owned a nucleus device which was similar to this device but was not a great device and had a lot of bugs and did not do much so i returned it this device is a masterpiece not only is it tied into the alexa echo universe it can be used as an intercom throughout your house with other echos and also can be used to view things and even call people that have echo directly it is an amazing piece of hardware and amazon should be proud of themselves for developing such a beautiful device,20
is good for the kids the only thing is i have to get a sd card for more memory,20
it was good works pretty easily the camera is good,20
i have always been a nook customer but recently their models have not received good feedback so while shopping for a new ereader i had to make the decision between the two the biggest influence behind price while the new samsung model of the nook definitely looks great it also has a big price tag overall we are very happy with this purchase it is mostly used as an ereader but we have downloaded a few games kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader,20
it was great product the price which i got it was great,20
great product that a whole family would enjoy it s a perfect addition to the household,20
was good price wish it had google play download on to it,20
simple great buy for your money if you are an avid reader,20
fits nicely in your hand and its touchable increase the size of the fonts,20
i really enjoy the sound it sounds so full my only disappointment is the limited functionality of the built in hub i had to purchase the hue hub to get full functionality other than that i love it,20
my son just loves it and he thinks it s easy to use and the case that comes on it has saved it,20
i love my echo show i wish you could watch movies or tc shows or you tube so hopefully they will add that soon,20
our entire family loves alexa and the white color looks great on our kitchen counters,20
looks nice can t wait to try it out great price for a tablet,20
this was a gift that i gave to my daughter at our family christmas party she loves it especially the ease of set up and the attached hub so she can control her lights her nest thermostat this has also gone over well with the grand children,20
easy to set up plus the screen is very clear and easy to view,20
the amazon echo plus is good buy it buy it you will love it,20
almost a week late from release date from ups but finally got this and set it up which was easy once in a while it doesn t hear you right but that s probably due to being feet away with the tv on other than that no problems,20
was told by sales person i could come back in a week with receipt to get off black friday price customer service lady said they don t do that i was misled item itself is okay,20
i was jealous when our son showed us his amazon show and some of the things it was capable of doing since aol eliminated instant messaging my wife and i were less able to communicate because our offices are on separate floors so we got two shows and two spots and now not only can intercom easily but use alexa for music and many other things we will probably start using some smart home devices which alexa can also control it s a fun device which seems to be getting better all the time,20
i have all the echo products in this by far is the best it does everything i love it,20
purchased one for my older son last year got this second d one for the younger one so they don t fight over them,20
despite not being able to get one of these from amazon until late june due to apparent strong demand best buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release april well done best buy having owned several previous kindles including the most recent paperwhite model i was unprepared for how small and light this new oasis model is reading about it is one thing but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely the oasis and its battery charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest paperwhite with no case the oasis without its cover feels impossibly light at ounces size wise the oasis is nearly a square shape at about wide by tall in fact the shape is so different from traditional kindle designs that i had to compare it next to my paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size they are it s the first kindle i think i could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort for frequent travelers like me this is a key reason to buy one of these as it s extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse the screen is the first front lit kindle i ve ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the leds from any angle no dark spots no bright spots just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions the page also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface helping achieve the illusion of printed paper it s sharp and clear better than any kindle i ve used the reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart since they are held together with magnets after doing so this is where the amazon engineering team s achievements really become clear as you just won t believe how lightweight this thing is it s easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it degrees when switching the display instantly rotates and the page turn buttons also follow with the top button always used to advance the page and the bottom button always used to go backward you can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models the battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover s battery so it runs down faster if you don t have it connected to the case it s very easy to snap the reader back into its cover which allows it to recharge while you continue to read the power button and charge port are located in the upper top right corner more or less opposite from where they are on the paperwhite i find this location to be less awkward as it s easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge the back surface of the reader not the case seems to easily attract fingerprints and they are not so easy to clean off you d think that amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now it s a minor annoyance lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model s high price relative to other kindle models without ads it s vs for an ad less paperwhite is this a lot of money perhaps but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that s easy on both your arms and your eyes then i personally think it s worth it a lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit and the price reflects that is it for everyone probably not but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you ll have to wait to get one on amazon s website if you are a serious reader this device deserves a very close look i m definitely keeping mine,20
the best tablet for kids the year unlimited apps is my favorite my kids love it,20
very good price good item would purchase again this was a gift,20
we have sonos speakers and a honeywell lyric thermostat it took a little searching on google to get things linked now that they are linked we can play music in any room and change our home temperature by using alexa,20
i am pleasantly surprised at how well this works i bought the e reader and it didn t work so i was nervous buying this kindle but it works great and my son loves it,20
the apps are better it charges faster and the camera is really neat,20
bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it it s so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls,20
i love this this memory card the price was good ty,20
speaker is pretty loud and i love that i can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the home button to use alexa,20
best item i ever use i would love to get another one,20
this has kept my kids entertained but maybe just a little too entertained sadly they don t want to do much else,20
my daughter loves her kindle and it s larger than the previous one she had she enjoys it,20
i purchase this tablet for my daughter s birthday and she absolutely loves it i am very pleased that she s not able to get online or to get on youtube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can t get into it i would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the google play store since it is an amazon tablet,20
this tablet is perfect for travel recently took it on a trip and the battery lasted the entire day with watching shows on and off on netflix great first tablet,20
excellent speaker love the portability and long lasting battery before a recharge is needed a very good digital assistant and lots of fun to use,20
i ve enjoyed using my fire hd tablet to play games,20
love this tablet power lasts long short charge time hd screen is really clear only con is that there are some apps not available like google play very satified have a gb card in mine plenty of space for downloads the camera has no flash and is not the best but i didnt buy this tablet for that high recommend the hd tablet gb amazon fire you want go wrong,20
alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated,20
we bought three including one for my year old we all love it the only complaint is the volume there is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers it doesn t bother us too much but that s why we give it stars overall a great tablet,20
exactly what i was looking for size wise and functional,20
love how it hooks up to lights and can play any music,20
wife love it reads a lot and this is her go to reader,20
loved the fire hd but the latest hd is sharper faster and still handles great,20
i use it mainly for reading e books and browsing however i wished there were more apps available also before unlocking the tablet ads are shown in the lockscreen if the tab is locked it stops streaming the ads you can pay to disable the ads permanently i only recommend this for basic use if you want to use it for games or other apps i would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy,20
this makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition but i m not sure i d want it as an adult there are much better tablets on the market but since it s cheap that s to be expected,20
this is a nice and inexpensive tablet great for reading on or looking up info on the internet only downfall is you can t download some online games onto it,20
the echo show feels useless after a few hours especially without the ability to watch youtube,20
love this product i can ask questions and play music also link my lights to it,20
can use many differents apps from the echo show awesome product,20
its a great product but for the cost the speakers are not what they should be and the screen is too small choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot i am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance,20
my sister in law recommended these to my wife and i and i thought i would try one they are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while,20
it works nice still seems like ancient techonology compared to any apple product,20
this is the only one you need it s like having the dot echo and ihome all in one with a screen,20
the amazon tap is a perfect complement to our amazon echo put this in our office space has all the advantages of the echo and is also a great bluetooth speaker having to tap the mic button to summon alexa is no issue at all sound quality is as good as any bluetooth speaker on the market and it s extremely portable,20
kids love it great christmas present even if not an apple product,20
i loved this tablet i did but i did not love that i was being sold ads every time i powered up i loathe even more that i would have had to pay to discontinue that feature amazon if you want dollars for the kindle fire charge it but don t under price the device and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity it is unbecoming of you i returned this item pronto,20
easy access to book reader love watching my netflix con slow getting on internet,20
this was a gift for my kids they love them easy to use and lots of great apps,20
was good price wish it had google play download on to it,20
bought for my kids and they love them they love the camera,20
absolutely love the echo show it is in my kitchen i love seeing my to do and shopping lists on there my calendar is there too plus i scroll pictures on it from my amazon prime photos love being able to get the daily news briefing from mpr every morning also use it for timing things would highly recommend it to amazon prime members got it at a great price on sale prior to christmas,20
my kid loves this it was one of his favorite christmas presents,20
the amazon tap is a perfect complement to our amazon echo put this in our office space has all the advantages of the echo and is also a great bluetooth speaker having to tap the mic button to summon alexa is no issue at all sound quality is as good as any bluetooth speaker on the market and it s extremely portable,20
my son loves his new tablet now he can play his games without making a mess of my phone,20
my wife s old kindle stopped holding a charge so to surprise her i stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle this kindle is great its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life my wife uses it every day this is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget,20
i bought of these for gifts i love my echo and think the new one will be incredible too after the holidays i will buy one for myself,20
the built in hue allows the echo plus to automatically search and finds connectable devices the larger speaker area assists in better sound and the alexa to hear my voice,20
currently setting everything up on it but so far so good,20
i had my doubts when i first purchased it but after just a day i had synced it with my thermostat lights tv bose sound system and many more amazing product couldn t be happier,20
we replaced and aging fire hdx she noticed the wifi connection is improved and the screen is larger she prefers this to my ipad air,20
easy to use and great selection of books movies and games,20
unable to try light bulb because it would not hook to echo plus waiting for rest of system,20
haven t been able to train alexa like we ve heard probably our own fault we have fun with it,20
bought two of these one for the living room and one for the bedroom great when you dont feel like walking to the living room and need to talk to your significant other honestly dont use it much but when i do its great music shopping stupid questions movie times etc,20
the color is what got me and the features was on point the screen shows a lot of different displays to share for now until the next one,20
good small tablet for all purposes for reading playing games,20
i have really enjoyed learning about the product and its many uses i thought initially music but now to get weather updates news receipies sports scores and ordering kitchen supplies,20
i bought it for my son in laws birthday after they bought me one for christmas not just good for music but helpful for grandkids homework and now we can video chat with grandkids which the one year old loves,20
i bought this after i bought the amazon echo this was actually an impulse buy i saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it because i enjoyed the echo so much it does everything the echo does but the sound quality is not great when you re playing at middle volume it s ok the lows are there but doesn t sound good i m guessing i m comparing it with the bose mini soundlink when you set the volume high the bass is almost non existent the mids and highs are loud with the louder volume another difference is that with tap you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands i do like the fact that it s portable because of that i m on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass,20
so my month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet however my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my ipad but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys which makes the kindle fire tablet for kids the best invention since the tivo all the pre loaded apps videos books etc is nothing short of amazing the case is also very cool hardwood floor and stair case proof for under bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine,20
this was a christmas present for the nephew works good he loves it,20
i previously owned a nucleus device which was similar to this device but was not a great device and had a lot of bugs and did not do much so i returned it this device is a masterpiece not only is it tied into the alexa echo universe it can be used as an intercom throughout your house with other echos and also can be used to view things and even call people that have echo directly it is an amazing piece of hardware and amazon should be proud of themselves for developing such a beautiful device,20
i purchased two of these tablets as a gift for christmas it has an exceptional hd screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book articles etc,20
i am totally addicted easy to use love the call feature,20
i m normally an apple snob but needed a cheap tablet and was very surprised how functional the amazon fire is,20
the best part about the echo is that you can actually use it to watch videos the security cameras connected to your house listen to music and watch the baby sleep i love my echo show,20
the kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu,20
i got the first version for my sister and she hasn t been able to put it down on over a year then i got her this one and forget about it great new features she loves loves loves it,20
runs great very efficient for what we use it for,20
works well and the speakers decent sounds much better than the nd generation of the echo,20
i purchased these tablets for my grandchildren after purchasing for another grandchild in october they love them and their parents love being able to dictate how they use them,20
i bought several alexa s for christmas gifts also for myself also bought amazon show for christmas gift also for a my youngest daugter,20
i love everything about this alexa if you re on the fence just buy it it does everything,20
got this to replace the samsung tab a that samsung tab lagged a lot but i haven t seemed to have as much problems on the fire tab the only downside is that the battery dies fast,20
it was easy to set up and use best buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features,20
love my amazon echo show however i wish alexa knew a little bit more,20
bought for my son works great great tablet for the,20
easy to set up we really enjoy getting real time local weather it translates spanish very efficiently we also enjoy the music we can easily select but would appreciate a higher quality sound linking the echo to lighting is a snap highly recommended,20
great tablet new to me so i have a lot to learn about it s functions,20
my daughter loves her kindle and it s larger than the previous one she had she enjoys it,20
nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better,20
this a great tablet for everyone plenty of memory for downloading great features all around,20
looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened,20
this product is easy to use and take along with you,20
already had and when these when bb had a big sale price i couldn t order it fast enough i can see my nest cameras another product make video calls to other show owners voice calls to anyone else except and a whole host of skills that are being added almost daily my only regret is not replacing my remaining echo dots when they were on sale i won t make that mistake on next big sale i also received of the other home assistants included as free bonuses for buying a couple of other things i thought that it was only fair to compare the two disregarging the video aspects of show amazon s shows and dots echos were like comparing lambourgini to a vw bug setting up these things are like the expression i heard as a kid easier than fallin of a log and not near as dangerous,20
i am so glad that i bought this echo it has made it easier to automate my music and my lights throughout my house we are still learning to use it but hope to add our thermostat as well to the items i can control with my alexa,20
my first ebook reader read some reviews decided to go with this because of the backlight and adaptive light sometimes i have to adjust the light manually but no biggie quick and easy on the eyes,20
great item for the new home better than purchasi this is a good product,20
i love my kindle it s perfect for reading my favorite books,20
i thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm i think it is too small to read on it not very comfortable as regular kindle would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead,20
amazon echo show is the best of all my amazon products i love the hands free but able to see things on the screen,20
biting as a gift my only concern was the size and the amazon interface it was easy enough to download the google play store so it was familiar to the user size was an initial concern but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome,20
this is a great tablet for the price amazon is doing a good job,20
i love my original kindle fire but the size and features on the latest kindle are a plus,20
echo show not only plays your music it puts up the lyrics to read from,20
love using this kindle to look up real estate sales play mind games and take pictures love the bigger screen and the great resolution sound is also far superior to my older model lindle,20
i got to say that love it makes it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my needs,20
this tablet has many educational games for a preschooler,20
we were interested in the echo line of products after we purchased our vivint security system the echo show is a perfect addition we are able to view our security cameras from the the echo show and it works great in general as an echo with all its features,20
so i bought my little guys these tablets so that i could repossess my ipad love the free time app but who could ve imagined they wouldn t play netflix so now i m out the money for the tablet and still don t have my ipad back and yes i called amazon numerous times they work after the fix but the next time they go to use them they don t work again the fix takes several minutes as it s force stopping the app clearing cache then doing a hard restart then you have to wait to restart netflix oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works if it works at all,20
not sure why but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it very disappointing,20
having fun with all the things we can learn from alexa it is almost like having another person in the house,20
the echo show is a great accessory to any house it has a great picture on it and great sound it s simple to use my wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists also listens to music with crisp sound can ask alexa pretty much anything,20
i bought the white version and have it in the kitchen i use it for everything music video phone security cams news weather it s the perfect kitchen assistant,20
got this on sale for replaces my cds must buy as long as you have prime,20
love how user friendly the kindle fire is for any age,20
great inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps,20
thoroughly enjoy my new show love the scrolling pictures,20
have been using this item and it seems to be working quite well,20
bought this for my teenage daughter and it works beautifully with great battery life,20
the only thing i would say is that you have to do a work around for direct tv other that that it is great,20
my kids loved it they were able to learn how to use it right away,20
my mom bought the tablets first for my sisters for christmas an then my year old wanted one so i purchased one for her she loves it uses it for games netflix an she is home school so she is able to do her work on the tablet as well,20
this was a christmas present for my niece she loved it,20
this is just perfect for my year old nothing fancy parental control is a bit confusing but i got it now the case is perfect to keep it safe just get a sd card for extra memory,20
granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday,20
just got this in the mail last night setting it up today and i want to love it the kicker for me buying it was being able to connect our arlo cameras and view instantly the display in the store had great sound,20
my children love these kindles they are so much better then the st ones we had the price is better as well,20
little putsy so far but there are continuous updates that i think will make this a great device to stay connected with family bought a second for my dad who knows he might replace his land line someday if this gets better i do think our original echo is a bit better at responding but i enjoy this one in the kitchen aka hub of the house,20
this is a great tablet because of all the preloaded games and ability to add more for free it keeps my kids entertained and is the best for learning,20
set up for kids right out of the box can t beat amazon s warranty either thanks for providing an outstanding product,20
makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that i can see a whole page at one time the protective cover that best buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the on off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that i had to find another cover from another source,20
too difficult to setup not compatible with other equipment,20
perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane,20
was told by sales person i could come back in a week with receipt to get off black friday price customer service lady said they don t do that i was misled item itself is okay,20
simple great buy for your money if you are an avid reader,20
this was a christmas present for the nephew works good he loves it,20
replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon with electronics in the cabin under scrutiny this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill perfect in small purses and large pockets i can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you re holding it,20
we bought this reader to replace a fire hdx that had seemed to go wonky turns out a couple of system resets and the hdx is back to normal so i get the old one she gets the new one but i can highly recommend this reader the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent,20
our whole family loves and uses this device for so many different features we love using it to make phone calls watch films play jeopardy even to define words as they come up in conversation we definitely get a lot of use out of this device more than any other screen tablet or smart phone device we own,20
easy to use love the color and my daughter loves it easy to set up very happy with my purchase,20
this tablet is great for trips just make sure you download games and shows on it first since it does not have internet the case is great for kids who are rough with technology it really takes a beating,20
i bought it for my fianc and he can t get enough of it awesome purchase,20
difficult to purchase no stock in stores no order online or ship to store available when it did become available it did not work once it turned on i couldn t get any further i could not log onto wifi network though other items in my household work also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock tried days gave up and returned the item,20
i loved the amazon echo but to be able to see so much more on the screen is amazing i highly recommend,20
works well with smart home lights door locks and wireless security cam,20
bought this tablet for my grandson and we couldn t be happier he loves it and it is easy to use created the children s account so he wouldn t be distracted by all the other goings on the internet bought this so he could play games do his school work as it links up nicely to the ixl and google class love the usage timer and the ability to lock it down i have loaded the google play store on it so we now access to many games and other apps no issues so far great buy for the money only down side i can see or in this case hear so far low sounding speaker could be a bit louder or better placed all in all you wont be disappointed in this purchase great for web page looks ups reading and playing games,20
excellent for what you pay and always good shopping at bestbuy,20
they are both responsive to each other and it gives me convenience i don t have to turn off the lights and all i do is lay down and ask alexa to turn off the light all my lights are connected to my echo plus,20
i love this tablet i got one for each one of the kids all different ages and they all love it,20
great product but the only downside is that it did not work with my home security camera,20
love this tablet it does everything i need it to my problem is i have family that falls in love with it so i give mine away if this wasn t good i wouldn t be on my rd one the only thing i would change is the silly ads and even worse browser other than that a solid product,20
if amazon and google can work things out the show will be amazing we already loved the echo and the dot and were looking forward to adding video unfortunately youtube is no longer on the show limiting the video content if they can ever get it back the show will definitely be a star product,20
as always great job very easy to use and it s always with me only problem i have is the button on the bottom is touchy but not really an issue keep up the good work,20
easy to use great cover and a lot of options for app games my daughter loves it,20
the only thing i would say is that you have to do a work around for direct tv other that that it is great,20
limited apps and a bit thicker than ipad but works,20
nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better,20
they make it seem like you can pretty much ask anything to alexa but she never knows anything it is very non responsive at times too,20
i have really enjoyed my new echo plus i enjoy music every morning with the news,20
this was a gift for christmas we bought this on a black friday sale price was reasonable,20
love this product i can ask questions and play music also link my lights to it,20
we got this for our yr old daughter and its perfect for her there hasn t been any issue with the games and educational apps she uses,20
the kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading,20
purchased this for my mother for her birthday she loves it the large screen is what she wanted most,20
easy to handle light weight i like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed,20
i am pleasantly surprised at how well this works i bought the e reader and it didn t work so i was nervous buying this kindle but it works great and my son loves it,20
this is a low cost item that provides huge returns for the money spent it is a great little tablet,20
this is my eighth kindle some others were either lost or screen damaged i bought it as a spare current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen great price also wish i d bought two,20
works as described love the kid friendly foam protector it stopped working within months of purchase amazon just sent new one without a real fuss inconvenient but no real fuss i hope this one lasts longer,20
have been pleased with my purchase of the fire hd as it s video quality is great when viewing espn netflix youtube tutorials the ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the amazon kindle app is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an ipad,20
fits easily into my purse or bag small compact,20
if nothing else i have peace of mind that should she fall or need assistance then i can now better assist,20
it has great speakers and is very easy to set up love my echo,20
this is a very good tablet the only con is you may have to reboot it too often,20
great item would definitely recommend this item am still learning all the things about it,20
its a lot more then we expected this is a wonderful addition to our tech life,20
i bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently she loves it and uses it all the time,20
this was a gift that i gave to my daughter at our family christmas party she loves it especially the ease of set up and the attached hub so she can control her lights her nest thermostat this has also gone over well with the grand children,20
excellent speaker love the portability and long lasting battery before a recharge is needed a very good digital assistant and lots of fun to use,20
makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that i can see a whole page at one time the protective cover that best buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the on off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that i had to find another cover from another source,20
we got this for our yr old daughter and its perfect for her there hasn t been any issue with the games and educational apps she uses,20
enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do initially disappointed by the small size but i quickly learned to appreciate it very portable and convenient i wanted something easy on the eyes with a g connection so i did not have to be connected to wifi to download books was a bit more then i wanted to pay but feel i will get good use out of it,20
i bought this tablet for it s inexpensive price and quality it s meant to be a portal to be able to purchase more products from amazon and services but it really is a high quality product,20
my family love alexa and so happy not having to buy any cd or another radio again,20
brought it for my son does exactly what i want it to do,20
a great value for the money you can save instead of a ipad from apple,20
had the echo plus over a week and this thing is amazing great sound and easy to move around a little tricky with the set up but works great,20
it s ok but i rather have bought samsung galaxy tab,20
i bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently she loves it and uses it all the time,20
alexa works great but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up,20
got it as a gift for my dad so far so good didn t not realise the special offers are ads spend more money to buy the one with out them also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection you now need wifi to connect to the store,20
this has quickly become one of the most used at the kitchen counter if you have alexa an you like it a must have upgrade,20
it s a nice upgrade from the screen size is just right for small kids hands reading kindle books is much easier,20
we bought one of these for our year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a christmas present for a year old parent it obviously isn t the highest quality tablet on the market but it very responsive and gets the job done and you can t beat the price just a great value,20
what is there to say but that i love it functions well and lasts a long time,20
i bought this for my daughter it s a little limited in what it can do but she loves it she s a little too young to understand the games but she loves watching cartoons on it,20
this tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children,20
absolutely love the echo show it is in my kitchen i love seeing my to do and shopping lists on there my calendar is there too plus i scroll pictures on it from my amazon prime photos love being able to get the daily news briefing from mpr every morning also use it for timing things would highly recommend it to amazon prime members got it at a great price on sale prior to christmas,20
i have always been a nook customer but recently their models have not received good feedback so while shopping for a new ereader i had to make the decision between the two the biggest influence behind price while the new samsung model of the nook definitely looks great it also has a big price tag overall we are very happy with this purchase it is mostly used as an ereader but we have downloaded a few games kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader,20
i don t know why i waited so long to bring alexa into my home it s how i listen to my music now dictate my shopping and to do lists and get my morning weather report just to name a few i highly recommend this item,20
this is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading,20
this device meets the needs of my grandson he can read and play games on it it also has the parental safeguards,20
i m not huge on kids using electronics but my son loves this when we take trips as he can play some of the downloaded games we love it for when we want to get stuff done and still want him to be occupied and this does the trick it s a little hard to navigate at first though,20
bought this for my teenage daughter and it works beautifully with great battery life,20
bought for daughter in law and she likes it she wanted a fire,20
this is great my daughters first tablet and it came with everything she needed to get started she loves the pink bumper guard and so do i for the safety,20
great product that a whole family would enjoy it s a perfect addition to the household,20
great notepad huge screen and easily downloaded apps to use love it,20
awesome product and cool design and a great color i would recommend to a friend,20
purchased this item for our daughter she absolutely loves it,20
it s the perfect tablet for a kid to watch cartoons and play games the protection is awesome,20
good tablet but no youtube kids like on iphone don t expect iphone pad quality very basic appstore for children,20
this is not an upgrade by any means my three year old kindle outperformed oasis battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak two pieces to keep up with unsnaps constantly amazon customer services promises it will resolved in an update,20
i am so glad that i bought this echo it has made it easier to automate my music and my lights throughout my house we are still learning to use it but hope to add our thermostat as well to the items i can control with my alexa,20
other similar devices do not have the voice recognition learning capability the echo plus has it is superior to all the others,20
this device meets the needs of my grandson he can read and play games on it it also has the parental safeguards,20
i love my kindle i m back to reading so much more often as i always have several books with me at all times at first it surprised me that this version doesn t have a back light and you need a light to read but i actually like it now as i don t get the eye strain like i do when using my phone,20
i originally got the lower end kindle took it back and upgraded the light really is a must i can t believe how much more i m reading now that i have it and there are tons of free books out there if you know where to look best purchase ever,20
love my amazon echo show however i wish alexa knew a little bit more,20

i have always been a nook customer but recently their models have not received good feedback so while shopping for a new ereader i had to make the decision between the two the biggest influence behind price while the new samsung model of the nook definitely looks great it also has a big price tag overall we are very happy with this purchase it is mostly used as an ereader but we have downloaded a few games kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader,20
i bought this tablet to replace one i had different brand that was worn out this is a pretty good tablet for the price i just wanted something to use til i could get something bigger i ve had no problems with it other than some of the games i played on my other one not being available on the fire,20

i bought this for my mom and she loves it she said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting it s easy for her to read,20
i bought this as a gift for christmas and it was well liked,20
this is the main reason why i went with amazon s echo ecosystem vs google home i bought one as a gift to my sister so i can easily videochat with my family my niece and nephew tend to fight over the echo show when they want to sing along to their favorite songs with the lyrics on the screen my only wish was that there was an hdmi out to connect it to a larger monitor huge missed opportunity in my opinion,20
i like that the tablet has child settings and time usage very helpful in setting time limits,20
i love my amazon fire tablet i m sure my kids will love theirs too,20
i bought two of these fire tablets for gifts for my sons they are both thrilled with the features they use them for gaming music photo albums emails and online activities the hd is what sold me i have a kindle fire nd generation and i enjoyed mine so much since i looked into getting this one,20
i picked this up after purchasing an echo i wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my echo i use both devices mostly for music it s great to be able to hear pandora or my amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone laptop etc i can just grab the tap and go anywhere in my house outside to the deck anywhere that i my wireless will reach,20

limited apps and a bit thicker than ipad but works,20
great speaker and the sound is great use it every day love being able to use alexa when attached to my network,20
the only thing i have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device why is that,20
i bought two of these for two of my children the parental controls are great and i can easily control their access to content the ability to make them do something educational like read for min before playing games is awesome this tablet does everything i wanted it to do,20
this was a purchase for christmas great tablet to surf the web or read books on would recommend for any age,20

this was one of the best birthday presents i ever purchased for my husband he said he doesn t use the computer but he was on my smartphone daily viewing fb i got him a drone for christmas and he needed something to view while it is flying i researched the kindle fire and thought he could practice with it until spring he farms so isn t busy in the winter thank goodness because he is busy with his kindle for hours every day he thinks it is great and i do too because now i have my phone back,20
this new fire tablet with gb of internal memory is an upgrade from my older gb version allowing more storage of books movies and apps,20
i wanted a speaker to listen to pandora and go so much more being able to speak to alexa and get news weather timer light controls and so much more love the product,20
works well we had one of the original fires and it finally died which is why we bought another great clarity and better internet also,20

the kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading,20
i can see my grandchildren when i call it is a great machine,20

i needed a simple tablet to use in my car on long trips bought two of these and boy do they deliver the best tablets for this price the kindle book reader is an added bonus the finishing is good my kids love it,20
i understood it did not have the wake command but it would be better if it had it other than that everything is wonderful with this speaker really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps just ask alexa and she plays the most recent episode,20
it did exactly what it s suppose to and i m still learning new features a month after having it very good decice,20
love the amazon alexa products i have show echo dots and the tap wish the tap had the drop in feature the tap does make a sound when you have the hands free enabled and say alexa instead of the blue lights on the other products great for taking outside,20
i have both the kindle voyage and the low end kindle fire while the fire is an amazing deal for serious readin g the kindle voyage is far easier on the eyes and has superior resolution now it lacks many of the features of the less expensive fire such as color and online with wifi as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure truthfully it isn t a whole lot better than the paperwhite it has a feature or two but i m not sure it s worth the extra dollars it is still an excellent device,20
got it as a gift for my dad so far so good didn t not realise the special offers are ads spend more money to buy the one with out them also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection you now need wifi to connect to the store,20

tablet is great for kids and adult use i purchased the tablet to use at school with students with disabilities the tablet holds up well holds a charge throughout the week the tablet offers games that do not require wi fi or data if you have a prime membership there are a lot of benefits when using the fire for example free apps free streaming movies music etc,20

i ve enjoyed using my fire hd tablet to play games,20
purchased this for my mother for her birthday she loves it the large screen is what she wanted most,20
better than nook also cheaper if toy areally looking to use as a tablet not the best choice great for reading and basic searching,20
i love the alexa system of assistance this version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won t get to have to the option to pick up you need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private i installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use,20
i gave my paperwhite to a friend and bought the voyage i like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages i don t know that it s really worth all of the extra cost compared to the paperwhite especially since the new one just came out with dpi,20
works well we had one of the original fires and it finally died which is why we bought another great clarity and better internet also,20

this a great tablet for everyone plenty of memory for downloading great features all around,20
i lie the size and weight for the kindle makes it very convenient to take large books with me in digital format,20
our whole family loves and uses this device for so many different features we love using it to make phone calls watch films play jeopardy even to define words as they come up in conversation we definitely get a lot of use out of this device more than any other screen tablet or smart phone device we own,20
i bought this as a backup i am currently using the same headphone,20
this was purchased for my older grandson age for christmas and as i stated in another review it has had games downloaded on it and will be ready to use when it is opened by him,20

this was a christmas present for my niece she loved it,20
biting as a gift my only concern was the size and the amazon interface it was easy enough to download the google play store so it was familiar to the user size was an initial concern but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome,20
i love my amazon fire tablet i m sure my kids will love theirs too,20
if you like to control smart gadgets this is definitely for you,20
good for beginners play games take picture and recording videos old the time,20
i bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale i ve been pleasantly surprised search sounds great for its size,20
got this tablet for my yr old daughter and it has been great for her it s the right size for her little hands only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it apps have to be from amazon and they might not have the app you want,20
this device is alot better than the small alexa did everything i wanted it to,20
granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday,20
i bought the kindle oasis for my wife as a th anniversary gift she enjoys reading and i thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice she tried it for a few days and didn t care for it she writes notes in the margins and wasn t happy with the way the kindle did its notes for just reading i think it would be a very nice product,20
bought this for my better half and she loves it it works very well with echo and has unlimited features,20
i was jealous when our son showed us his amazon show and some of the things it was capable of doing since aol eliminated instant messaging my wife and i were less able to communicate because our offices are on separate floors so we got two shows and two spots and now not only can intercom easily but use alexa for music and many other things we will probably start using some smart home devices which alexa can also control it s a fun device which seems to be getting better all the time,20
i upgraded to have more memory and this is a great little tablet works great and does everything i need it to do,20
i would recommend this to anyone who like to speak commands to technology and have it respond i purchased this for my husband who is sick and he can ask for weather music sport events and more great item,20
bought this for a gift for some one who s old tablet won t work just the right size to play games on,20
very impressed set up a little confusing but overall a good experience still learning however best buy emails give away any gift secrets had to reset my account to a work email address,20
gift for great nephew have that are and y o both love these tablets because each got one play with them as much as mom allows,20
the kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu,20

it takes forever to download apps i m returning it will be getting something else,20
ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it larger screen and colored case are a big plus,20
very nice people and good product i would buy from again,20
set up was simple we liked so much we bought one for my mom,20
i am so glad that i bought this echo it has made it easier to automate my music and my lights throughout my house we are still learning to use it but hope to add our thermostat as well to the items i can control with my alexa,20
this tablet does a great deal from surfing the net to watching movie and using all of the music channels this is an affordable way to stay in touch also i use it for ebooks for school,20
this product is amazing i wasn t quite sure why everyone was going on and on about having one but now that it s in my house i cannot imagine life without it alexa not only answers my questions and gives me valuable information but now she controls the lights of my house for me i highly recommend this,20
i talk myself into the g and i am so glad i did i have used only kindles for the past years and i love them i love the color as well,20
not a substitute for an ipad but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage,20

good tablet gave as gift and person enjoys it recommend,20
we have always been nexus tablet desciples and in fact have bought of them for self and family members this one was for granddaughter to replace nexus that had gotten slow this one works better faster than the nexus it s fast easy to use perfect tablet for a child or teenager and can t beat the price very pleased with purchase,20
i ve love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area that is what i got and more i very satisfied except it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and i am back to satisfaction,20

purchased for my grandson he loves it when setting up be sure to update the software,20
this is a fantastic item the person i bought it for loves it,20
i love it easy to use many different features,20
it can stream music really well and not just from amazon i was expecting it to be smart like watson but it is more like an blank stare amazon should look into predicting questions like during superbowl play offs alexa was unable to display or update the play off brackets it understands my voice really well were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what i am saying it want pair to my portable bluetooth speaker it will pair to my cell phone but only to receive music from it the audio quality is varies with amplitude with low amplitudes alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room but an amplitude setting of about the audio becomes clear and understandable i really like playing games like jeopardy with alexa no climbing through the closet to find a box anymore and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing,20
i was using the original echo seldomly then i decided to get the show i use the show a lot more was simple to set up and you can make calls with video great product,20
i have dots and an echo and this just sounds better and looks better,20
she love it she said it easy to use she love it very much,20
bestbuy delivered this on the day of release amazon still seems to be back ordered it is a great product nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance,20
when you can get this thing on sale it s an amazing deal have all of your amazon features right in your face books manga gaming amazon it s easy to hold has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen sure the galaxy tablets have better specs but it s the price and features you get from amazon that make this device amazing,20
this was a gift for christmas we bought this on a black friday sale price was reasonable,20
great tablet and price ordering online easy not happy took so long to receive though,20
i ve had lots of tablets in the past mostly from the samsung line but this is my first amazon fire so i want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these at the time that this was written alexa had not been added to the tablet first while this device runs an android type of operating system amazon puts its own spin on the operating system i don t feel like i m using android this feels different to me it doesn t have the same level of customization that android users have come to appreciate that being said if you are an amazon prime member this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine it s simply a fun way to consume your magazines books etc there are on screen buttons on the bottom of the device the middle button immediately takes you to your home screen the button to the left acts as a sort of back button it also lets me get rid of my keyboard when i don t need it on screen but it s open the button to the right is super important it took me a couple of days to realize what it does that square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open it lets you switch between apps but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out you can close them by pressing the x button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right if you leave all of those apps open and you never close them you ll drain your battery make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps the device has several menus that you swipe left to view first you start with your home screen you literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet all of your apps are housed here you swipe up to view all of them the tablet comes with several apps pre installed such as slik amazon s own internet browser audible good reads the amazon app store a weather app etc you can go to the amazon app store to download other apps such as twitter facebook etc you can combine the apps on this page into folders you just drag one app to another app and a folder appears this made my home screen much more manageable you can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings this feature doesn t necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps however i believe it only changes the font on your main screens if you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device when you have a new issues it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of new items the device comes with a free month subscription to the washington post you ll see that under new items when you initially activate your tablet you can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos you can do this through the settings menu on the device if you want to use one of your own photos however you need to either take it on the device or move it into amazon s photos app which is a cloud based app so far i haven t found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper i m not crazy about the amazon photo app i found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into amazon s cloud just so i could view them on my tablet that being said i m not planning to take photos on this device i just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper beyond the home screen you can swipe to the right to view your other screen they are pre arranged to be books videos games shop apps music audiobooks and newstand all of those screens are connected to your amazon account for example if you have kindle books you ve already purchased they automatically will appear under the books menu your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu there doesn t seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages that bugs me but it s not the end of the world there s also one menu to the left of the home menu it s the recent page it shows you what you ve received looked at on the tablet i never use it but it might be handy for some people one of my favorite features of this tablet is amazon s on deck capability if you re an amazon prime member amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like the items don t count against your pre installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full you can turn off the on deck feature if you don t like it i ve been content with the video playback capability this isn t my major use of the device but the images look fine and the audio is ok i ll talk more about the speakers later my other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the newstand i ve tried magazines on here and they all look gorgeous now i can always have my magazines with me so if i m stuck at the airport or at the doctor s office i always have them one of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free i just had to connect my account to the device this allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as i ve had an account my other magazine didn t include a digital edition so i canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version it was an inexpensive magazine anyway there are several magazines that you can try free for days on the device i did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure the kindle fire doesn t come with the google play store installed you can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty you can google to find the instructions to do this it s not difficult to do if you re fairly comfortable with technology it probably took me minutes most of the apps i wanted were in the amazon store but there were a handful that i had paid for through google play the only way i could have them was to go back to access that store they have worked fine so far i despise the keyboard that amazon pre installed on this device there are no lines between the letters on the keyboard i suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys but i hate it i fixed that problem by going to google play and downloading a new keyboard it was a pretty easy problem to solve so i can t complain apps that are connecting to the internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets but that generally doesn t bother me if you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop however that might drive you crazy the screen on this device isn t bad if i compare it to my fancy phone it s not as shape but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone the screen is outstanding the speakers are ok there are two of them located on the bottom of the screen i won t say that they are fantastic they aren t in my opinion they are fine for watching youtube or a television show they are not ok for listening to music if you are an audiophile you can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre install app but still your music will sound tinny that being said you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker use a pair of headphones etc this device wasn t made for taking pictures it has a front and back camera but they aren t designed to be spectacular i m not using them i find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands i think that s partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick also i do have some hand problems similar to someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome i think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives i m still waiting for it i m greatly enjoying this device it s simply fun to use the tablet there are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use amazon services if you don t typically use amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the internet and you re looking for a low price tag this device may be ok for you,20
i bought this tablet for my grandson and he absolutely loves it,20
the family and i love alexa view and once we got it we were hooked now everything in the house and outside is run by voice commands the opportunities with this are endless,20
bought this tablet for my grandson and we couldn t be happier he loves it and it is easy to use created the children s account so he wouldn t be distracted by all the other goings on the internet bought this so he could play games do his school work as it links up nicely to the ixl and google class love the usage timer and the ability to lock it down i have loaded the google play store on it so we now access to many games and other apps no issues so far great buy for the money only down side i can see or in this case hear so far low sounding speaker could be a bit louder or better placed all in all you wont be disappointed in this purchase great for web page looks ups reading and playing games,20
this little sorcerer s box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors,20
really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter learning i do wish it had more storage and more items for kids but we do love the tablet,20
easy to use quick setup fantastic screen and the colors are vibrant,20
set up for kids right out of the box can t beat amazon s warranty either thanks for providing an outstanding product,20
i bought this for my year old nephew for christmas he loves it and it has a great warranty,20
the kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu,20
i was reluctant to purchase the echo plus and my best friend said to do it you will love it i did and she was so right the philips hue light bulb was an added bonus and love that too,20
purchased this for year old boy and couldn t be happier,20
makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that i can see a whole page at one time the protective cover that best buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the on off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that i had to find another cover from another source,20
i bought two of these for two of my children the parental controls are great and i can easily control their access to content the ability to make them do something educational like read for min before playing games is awesome this tablet does everything i wanted it to do,20
the tablet is very light and streams well i only use it to stream movies and it s much ligher then an ipad so makes mobility that much better,20
my brother told me about this product i bought it for my son and he loves it,20
purchased for an year old that wanted this badly appears to be rugged links up with my amazon account for content and access year warranty win,20
the new tablet is great nice upgrades love how easy it is to use easy to get apps shop and browse the web,20
i love my amazon fire hd it s not too small and not too big i was looking at other tablets and decided on the amazon fire hd because of the price and because i have amazon prime i purchased it online at best buy and then picked it up at the store on black friday it is my first tablet and so i wanted to start with one that i can have fun with and i am i do have a laptop for important things,20
i m not a techie but after days of trying to hook up i gave up i don t know if it was the echo plus or my carrier att uverse causing the issue but it would not connect so back to the store it went even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistance none of it worked,20
i bought this for controlling most of my smart device,20
i purchased of these fire hd tablets as gifts they pack a lot of punch for the price i helped set them up so i was able to get an idea of how they are going to work the screen was very nice and clear speed of tablet was good it is easy to use if you are already in the amazon family through prime it is a no brainer i don t believe you can get a better tablet at this price point,20
my year old mom loves this she now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices loves to read do crosswords etc,20
i love this tablet it is the right size and i love playing movies on it,20
i got this for my daughter she enjoy playing this,20
i had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things the extra ram makes a difference very happy and if you re a prime member there are lots of freebies,20
this is the only one you need it s like having the dot echo and ihome all in one with a screen,20
speaker is pretty loud and i love that i can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the home button to use alexa,20
had the echo plus over a week and this thing is amazing great sound and easy to move around a little tricky with the set up but works great,20
i m still learning what all i can do with this device but i am continually amazed at it s capabilities i love playing with it and learning from it when doing other things i have tap playing music i love this thing,20
it did exactly what it s suppose to and i m still learning new features a month after having it very good decice,20
i ve had my fire hd for about a year and have been very satisfied with it my wife has been using an older fire non hd and i thought it was time for an upgrade for her so i decided to buy her this new fire hd for christmas i also installed a sceen protector a new case and a gb sd card before wrapping it she was very surprised and pleased and she noticed the big difference in speed sound and picture quality immediately i m very happy she likes it so much thanks amazon for the great product and best buy for the great price,20
i just love this tap it is so much fun the music is so great i play the relation music every night every night best thing ever,20
very impressed set up a little confusing but overall a good experience still learning however best buy emails give away any gift secrets had to reset my account to a work email address,20
i didon t care for this tablet downloading apps outside of amazon was really confusing,20
love the new fire great for books games and getting online easy to use features and perfect size screen to take on the go,20
just got this in the mail last night setting it up today and i want to love it the kicker for me buying it was being able to connect our arlo cameras and view instantly the display in the store had great sound,20
simply love it it s loud love watching videos,20
amazon kindle fire has a lot of free app and can be used by any one that wants to get online anywhere,20
exchanged the google google home for this model fun for the kids finding new uses for it every day had a problem when best buy forgot to include the free light bulb,20
great choice battery life outstanding many kid friendly features,20
this is a great product i also have a dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus the hands free mode works just like the dot and the sound is great i use the tap all the time working on projects making shopping lists playing games to turning on the lights i looked at the echo but even with a battery pack it didn t seem very mobile,20
very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don t work very well charging port very low quality,20
i love the capability to see it on the screen and it allows me to not have to use my hands,20
pleased with alexa have not used light yet i ll update after use,20
love this tablet it does everything i need it to my problem is i have family that falls in love with it so i give mine away if this wasn t good i wouldn t be on my rd one the only thing i would change is the silly ads and even worse browser other than that a solid product,20
our entire family loves alexa and the white color looks great on our kitchen counters,20
my kid love this tablet the setup was so easy and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps that my kid can enjoy playing and learning,20
no problems so far i m enjoying it suggestion it should come with some outputs plugs to connect it to bigger speakers sound system,20
bought of these for christmas for my family members i ve had mine for a year in my kitchen and just love it so much you can do with it and works great with my arlo pro cameras big plus amazon is always updating the show to do more,20
this was a perfect tablet for my year old it does everything that she needed it to,20
this tablet does a great deal from surfing the net to watching movie and using all of the music channels this is an affordable way to stay in touch also i use it for ebooks for school,20
the echo show feels useless after a few hours especially without the ability to watch youtube,20
the apps are better it charges faster and the camera is really neat,20
i love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can t get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which i don t because i have a four and year old there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups,20
excellent value lets me lug all my favorite books around and read whenever wouldn t be without it,20
it worked really well for me as i am unschooled in ipads i used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things i needed i e maps books downloaded internet access youtube etc i don t play games so cannot comment on that,20
i really enjoy the sound it sounds so full my only disappointment is the limited functionality of the built in hub i had to purchase the hue hub to get full functionality other than that i love it,20
i got this for my daughter she enjoy playing this,20
my family love alexa and so happy not having to buy any cd or another radio again,20
my and year old download their own games easy to set up and get working thanks to parental control i know what they are downloading,20
i bought several alexa s for christmas gifts also for myself also bought amazon show for christmas gift also for a my youngest daugter,20
my son loves his kindle fire tablet it is perfect,20
it has very limited use without adding on expensive apps or adding more wireless speakers i am considering returning the merchandise,20
this is a good tablet for my son to use to play his games,20
i bought this for my daughter for christmas i could set her as a user and make it safe for her age i downloaded books and apps with ease i m glad that she is loving her fire,20
through all of my research this was the best value for what i was looking for in an e reader with additional options i was not sure i would use or not turns i do because of the ease of usage,20
my sister in law recommended these to my wife and i and i thought i would try one they are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while,20
the show is a great little product it has opened a lot of doors in the world of ai and home automation for me it connected easily with my echo and dot and now i can stream music all over my house the picture quality is outstanding the only drawback is that alexa doesn t have a very strong internet search engine,20
great product for when you are on the go great sound,20
this is not like other android tablets in a bad way,20
my niece and nephew are going to love this i got it for a great price too what a nice christmas present,20
this tablet is perfect for my six year old s learning apps,20
i bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit i set it up with her as the user entered her age and name and now amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age simple to do and she loves the capabilities i also bought and installed a gig sd card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage for the price i think this tablet is best one out there you can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost,20
this item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing the only con is that amazon doesn t have some of the apps that google play has,20
sound is amazing wish alexa knew more things i get a lot of i m sorry i don t know that which is unfortunate,20
great tablet for streaming good internet connection along with a nice display,20
i ve had lots of tablets in the past mostly from the samsung line but this is my first amazon fire so i want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these at the time that this was

best electronic i purchased for myself this year great price too,20
this was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books couple this with amazon gift cards and the library is endless,20
great inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps,20
i love this this memory card the price was good ty,20
like the fact that i can see videos and utilize ir with my lighting system,20
this is the main reason why i went with amazon s echo ecosystem vs google home i bought one as a gift to my sister so i can easily videochat with my family my niece and nephew tend to fight over the echo show when they want to sing along to their favorite songs with the lyrics on the screen my only wish was that there was an hdmi out to connect it to a larger monitor huge missed opportunity in my opinion,20
i was jealous when our son showed us his amazon show and some of the things it was capable of doing since aol eliminated instant messaging my wife and i were less able to communicate because our offices are on separate floors so we got two shows and two spots and now not only can intercom easily but use alexa for music and many other things we will probably start using some smart home devices which alexa can also control it s a fun device which seems to be getting better all the time,20
great screen resolution and easy to use battery life is really good,20
so i was skeptical of echo show and the entire line to be honest however this technology has changed how our household operates from my daily briefing in the morning to tracking santa with my year old every morning learning interesting facts about santa and several other things i truly wish i would have bought this sooner we have it integrated into our cozi account so we can just ask alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in we also have adt pulse and a nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple i couldn t believe it my son loves to ask alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is i am loving the amazon music now as well because we bought an echo dot just to integrate into our bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now if you are on the fence about getting the echo show like i was just do it it really is an amazing product,20
this kindle fire blows away my other tablet for performance battery life readability color and many other options i love this size as well,20
my and year old download their own games easy to set up and get working thanks to parental control i know what they are downloading,20
i love to read books books books and more books,20
great looking display text is sharp and easy to read the lighting of screen is wonderful for reading in lower light environments this is a little more compact than the paper white model i really love the page press button areas makes it so you can turn pages without adjusting your hand as long as you are holding the voyage with your thumb resting in the button area sounds like a minor thing but to me it s a big convenience,20
i love this tablet i got one for each one of the kids all different ages and they all love it,20
i ve had other kindles and when my current ones storage became low i knew i wanted to purchase another one it can be used for a variety of uses,20
purchased as a christmas gift for my grandson he loved it,20
i love this this memory card the price was good ty,20
i have all the echo products in this by far is the best it does everything i love it,20
i love my echo show elexa is so helpfull she answers just about every question i have,20
i use this hours a day whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo device the battery life sound quality and voice recognition is great,20
purchased this for my son has room to upgrade memory to allow more books games but the speakers could be better or located in a better position,20
i haven t used this yet it is a gift for my father but i think he ll love it,20
awseome tablet for kids i would recommend this tablet for all age groups,20
works very well cheaper than an ipad and works great for apps and video,20
i ve had other kindles and when my current ones storage became low i knew i wanted to purchase another one it can be used for a variety of uses,20
my year old son really enjoys the tablet it s great,20
haven t been able to train alexa like we ve heard probably our own fault we have fun with it,20
i am loving my amazon echo show it makes life easier i love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking alexa i also love being able to video call friends and family that have an echo show or the alexa app overall it is a great product,20
this is my second kindle have a few more items to learn but love it easy to get around the apps,20
amazon built upon the success of their echo i m really enjoying the convenience of the echo with the added display,20
i don t know why i waited so long to bring alexa into my home it s how i listen to my music now dictate my shopping and to do lists and get my morning weather report just to name a few i highly recommend this item,20
great for my son i monitor school work and apps he downloads,20

i had always been looking to upgrade my original kindle i love the new touch features and display on this one the size also makes it very easy to transport,20
i m very happy with my purchase i bought one because my wife has one and is very happy with hers,20
this is not like other android tablets in a bad way,20
i lie the size and weight for the kindle makes it very convenient to take large books with me in digital format,20
bought for our son so he wouldn t have to carry books back from his deployment,20
works good have to be very careful with kids overall good product,20
so my month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet however my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my ipad but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys which makes the kindle fire tablet for kids the best invention since the tivo all the pre loaded apps videos books etc is nothing short of amazing the case is also very cool hardwood floor and stair case proof for under bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine,20
works very well cheaper than an ipad and works great for apps and video,20

i love it it works great i love the drop in func,20
i gave this amazon fire hd as a retirement gift for my friend and she absolutely loves it,20
easy to set up we really enjoy getting real time local weather it translates spanish very efficiently we also enjoy the music we can easily select but would appreciate a higher quality sound linking the echo to lighting is a snap highly recommended,20
i enjoyed and i bought an echo too to make all my family take the pleasure of it,20
this is a nice little tablet for me since i don t do a lot on a tablet it s a great size it took a little getting use to working with but am a little more comfortable with it now,20
i talk myself into the g and i am so glad i did i have used only kindles for the past years and i love them i love the color as well,20
the graphics and sound on this tablet were better than expected,20
my mom bought the tablets first for my sisters for christmas an then my year old wanted one so i purchased one for her she loves it uses it for games netflix an she is home school so she is able to do her work on the tablet as well,20
replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon with electronics in the cabin under scrutiny this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill perfect in small purses and large pockets i can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you re holding it,20

this tablet is not only a great price but exactly what i needed for quick internet access and to download books,20
i have always been a nook customer but recently their models have not received good feedback so while shopping for a new ereader i had to make the decision between the two the biggest influence behind price while the new samsung model of the nook definitely looks great it also has a big price tag overall we are very happy with this purchase it is mostly used as an ereader but we have downloaded a few games kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader,20
exchanged the google google home for this model fun for the kids finding new uses for it every day had a problem when best buy forgot to include the free light bulb,20
bought for husband to replace his old one uses it all the time and would recommend,20
this is my eighth kindle some others were either lost or screen damaged i bought it as a spare current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen great price also wish i d bought two,20
this is a fantastic item the person i bought it for loves it,20
i purchased this for my and year old grandchildren they were using parents phones and running the battery down now they have their own device and can watch their cartoons and play games love the case it makes it easy for little hands to hold on to overall very good purchase,20
bought this mostly as a backup and to read a few books since i have a larger cell phone and a back up used it occasionally may or hours of use till this week when i sent my laptop in for repairs so i probably used it a tot this week i was watching my rd primetime video this week and it simply turned off it will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode it is gone it is toast bought it october it quit on february my old fire lasted or years with more use it had stereo speakers lasted a week on a charge not or days sturdier built this is full of junk i am not just offered more apps it is constantly trying to add them junk junk junk,20
very nice easy to use got it to use with amazon prime great combo,20
the show is our new best friend we watch shows on it everyday at lunch time and we end every night saying alexa turn off screen,20
got it as a christmas gift and i love it i would recommend this product,20
my brother told me about this product i bought it for my son and he loves it,20
purchased this for my wife during christmas and got a great deal on it compared to the older version that she has this model is faster brighter and more convenient with alexa i would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it,20
it was great product the price which i got it was great,20
my year old mom loves this she now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices loves to read do crosswords etc,20
purchased this for my mother for her birthday she loves it the large screen is what she wanted most,20
best kindle charger ever took minutes to being my kindle back to life,20

great speaker able to move around connect to ipad when watching movies love it,20
love the new fire great for books games and getting online easy to use features and perfect size screen to take on the go,20
we have been using our kindle fire for years and it wore out we looked at replacing it with another fire until i saw the fire the display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference,20
durable worth every penny got it for our year old daughter amazed how easily she can navigate it,20
i upgraded to have more memory and this is a great little tablet works great and does everything i need it to do,20
we love alexa great addition to our family lol but seriously you can rely on alexa,20
bought this for my year old grandson who s a bit rough but loves to play games and read he loves it,20
purchased this for my son has room to upgrade memory to allow more books games but the speakers could be better or located in a better position,20
i ve enjoyed using my fire hd tablet to play games,20
alexa is amazin i love the features their great just love it,20
purchased due to reviews and in sale so far easy to use,20
when you can get this thing on sale it s an amazing deal have all of your amazon features right in your face books manga gaming amazon it s easy to hold has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen sure the galaxy tablets have better specs but it s the price and features you get from amazon that make this device amazing,20
the grandkids love this tablet easy for them to use,20
bought this kindle for my grandson he loves it and it very easy to use,20
this kindle fire is lighter than my old one the speed is great all apps load very quickly i also like that it comes in different colors,20
i purchased this product because i love to read and buying books got costly with this product i can read all i want for a month,20
very easy to use and navigate my and year old grandsons can use them with ease some apps are limited as you do not have google play but there is plenty of games and learning games available,20
great product and service will refer to a friend and the sales man r good,20
i wasn t offer the warranty but i enjoy it a lot,20
i decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and i do not regret my decision at all the only con for those evaluating this as a tablet is that amazon has their own app store many apps from googleplay appstore are simply not available,20
this was one of the best birthday presents i ever purchased for my husband he said he doesn t use the computer but he was on my smartphone daily viewing fb i got him a drone for christmas and he needed something to view while it is flying i researched the kindle fire and thought he could practice with it until spring he farms so isn t busy in the winter thank goodness because he is busy with his kindle for hours every day he thinks it is great and i do too because now i have my phone back,20
meh it works i find it difficult to navigate i also have an ipad mini this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad,20
nice size very clear but randomly shuts off cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen if you watch video it buffers alot and laggs,20
i like it i use it everyday and so far no cons im very please,20
excellent for what you pay and always good shopping at bestbuy,20
i am so glad that i bought this echo it has made it easier to automate my music and my lights throughout my house we are still learning to use it but hope to add our thermostat as well to the items i can control with my alexa,20
alexa is now a family member how have i lived my life without her i have no idea,20
this is a must have is great for recepies while you are cooking alexa gives you the info for the ines that are used to a tablet or ipod that you have to stop and read this is awesome plus so much easier to follow things,20
i bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit i set it up with her as the user entered her age and name and now amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age simple to do and she loves the capabilities i also bought and installed a gig sd card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage for the price i think this tablet is best one out there you can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost,20
was recommended to purchase by a family member who has one who is very happy with it,20
the grandkids love this tablet easy for them to use,20
i use this thing every night to fall asleep although alexa don t always understand me i still love the device,20
i love the alexa system of assistance this version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won t get to have to the option to pick up you need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private i installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use,20
i use it mainly for reading e books and browsing however i wished there were more apps available also before unlocking the tablet ads are shown in the lockscreen if the tab is locked it stops streaming the ads you can pay to disable the ads permanently i only recommend this for basic use if you want to use it for games or other apps i would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy,20
great speaker and echo substitute this is great for on the go as a bluetooth speaker and when connected to the internet it works great using the alexa app,20
using the kindle to read books and stream videos is very easy and enjoyable,20
love the new fire great for books games and getting online easy to use features and perfect size screen to take on the go,20
i bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints,20
the kindle is amazing this is my second one the price was misleading however as i had to pay something like another extra bucks to get rid of the ads just know that,20
i picked this up after purchasing an echo i wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my echo i use both devices mostly for music it s great to be able to hear pandora or my amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone laptop etc i can just grab the tap and go anywhere in my house outside to the deck anywhere that i my wireless will reach,20
amazon kindle is always the best ebook upgrade every new model,20
i love the alexa system of assistance this version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won t get to have to the option to pick up you need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private i installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use,20
they make it seem like you can pretty much ask anything to alexa but she never knows anything it is very non responsive at times too,20
product is good light amazing battery backup i charge the kindle one in weeks great product for reasonable price usb connection is easy books are easy to download overall everyone must have kindle with them and this is the best product model to start with understandably this is the beginner level model for people who never used kindle before features like led lights white paper background are not available on this model these features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in dark without lights but again for this price you would not get any other good readers if you are someone who reads in dark then i would suggest go for higher kindle models,20
i talk myself into the g and i am so glad i did i have used only kindles for the past years and i love them i love the color as well,20
i have enjoyed learning about home automation using echo plus and consumers need to know that this comes with having to buy additional equipment to get the most out of alexa,20
great value from best buy bought at christmas sale,20
bought the echo first and liked it so much i bought a tap to add mobility i carry it around all the time to the garage working out etc,20
this item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing the only con is that amazon doesn t have some of the apps that google play has,20
alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated,20
my grandson really enjoys his new kindle that he for for a christmas present,20
great product that a whole family would enjoy it s a perfect addition to the household,20
works good have to be very careful with kids overall good product,20
this is my third one of these and this is the best one by far,20
great item would definitely recommend this item am still learning all the things about it,20
this kindle fire blows away my other tablet for performance battery life readability color and many other options i love this size as well,20
this is a great tablet because of all the preloaded games and ability to add more for free it keeps my kids entertained and is the best for learning,20
i talk myself into the g and i am so glad i did i have used only kindles for the past years and i love them i love the color as well,20
my year old love to watch movies and this is perfect for him,20
little putsy so far but there are continuous updates that i think will make this a great device to stay connected with family bought a second for my dad who knows he might replace his land line someday if this gets better i do think our original echo is a bit better at responding but i enjoy this one in the kitchen aka hub of the house,20
my fire is compact and easy to use mainly used to read online books at lunch time the battery lasts much longer than previous tablet i had and charges much quicker very happy with my fire,20
great tablet for my and year old kid friendly safe and mom and dad enjoy it as well love that it comes in a protective case reasonably priced for a great tablet the kids love,20
works well worth the price good quality product have not had a problem,20
great speaker and echo substitute this is great for on the go as a bluetooth speaker and when connected to the internet it works great using the alexa app,20
it did exactly what it s suppose to and i m still learning new features a month after having it very good decice,20
got it as a gift for my dad so far so good didn t not realise the special offers are ads spend more money to buy the one with out them also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection you now need wifi to connect to the store,20
i love amazon products easy to use and install i recommend them very good sound and above all price,20
great product but the only downside is that it did not work with my home security camera,20
the kids love it they ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer i really like for the music aspect just tell it a song and it finds it,20
best item i ever use i would love to get another one,20
i use it mainly for reading e books and browsing however i wished there were more apps available also before unlocking the tablet ads are shown in the lockscreen if the tab is locked it stops streaming the ads you can pay to disable the ads permanently i only recommend this for basic use if you want to use it for games or other apps i would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy,20
i love it it works great i love the drop in func,20
i waited a couple months to review giving amazon time to make this product equal to the sony dash from nearly a decade ago it isn t the screen provides nothing of value and you can t turn of amazon tips you have near zero customization can t even move the clock to the other side of the screen and something that a sony dash did nearly years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm seriously this is the biggest fail run away from this half baked amazon disaster,20
fantastic product and does exactly as described great gift idea,20
very impressed set up a little confusing but overall a good experience still learning however best buy emails give away any gift secrets had to reset my account to a work email address,20
i loved the amazon echo but to be able to see so much more on the screen is amazing i highly recommend,20
i bought this for my daughter it s a little limited in what it can do but she loves it she s a little too young to understand the games but she loves watching cartoons on it,20
enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do initially disappointed by the small size but i quickly learned to appreciate it very portable and convenient i wanted something easy on the eyes with a g connection so i did not have to be connected to wifi to download books was a bit more then i wanted to pay but feel i will get good use out of it,20
very handy to get the morning news as well as asking him to play music,20
this is just perfect for my year old nothing fancy parental control is a bit confusing but i got it now the case is perfect to keep it safe just get a sd card for extra memory,20
i bought shows and i am loving them them video flash briefing are wonderful and personalized i don t have to keep my phone on me to keep in touch with my closest family members they can just drop in and i can do the same with the kids when away from the house i made more purchases immediately after to put them in my office and living room i love the lyrics when music is playing and looking at the forecast on the fly they are a must have for a modern home,20
purchased this for my mother for her birthday she loves it the large screen is what she wanted most,20
this has quickly become one of the most used at the kitchen counter if you have alexa an you like it a must have upgrade,20
she love it she said it easy to use she love it very much,20
the graphics and sound on this tablet were better than expected,20
love the look love the size love that it is visual,20
the graphics and sound on this tablet were better than expected,20
highly impressed with my purchase allows me to use my ipad again since my years old granddaughter finally has her own tablet great support and numerous educational apps for children,20
no problems so far i m enjoying it suggestion it should come with some outputs plugs to connect it to bigger speakers sound system,20
bought the echo first and liked it so much i bought a tap to add mobility i carry it around all the time to the garage working out etc,20
this is a great tablet for the price amazon is doing a good job,20
i bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips,20
i bought it for my fianc and he can t get enough of it awesome purchase,20
your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps videos and the internet you can not get a better deal the yr anything happens warranty is a big plus it s not the fastest thing on the market it s desent picture quality is great everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy love the fact that i can program it to have her read mins st before she can fully access it also that i can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week,20
always a good price and good for what it s meant for,20
the display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good probably better for reading than watching videos we didn t really get it for the games but there is a good selection wifi works well and internet browsing is fast,20
my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her kindle,20
i purchased these tablets for my grandchildren after purchasing for another grandchild in october they love them and their parents love being able to dictate how they use them,20
the new tablet is great nice upgrades love how easy it is to use easy to get apps shop and browse the web,20
alexa is now a family member how have i lived my life without her i have no idea,20
i bought this tablet for my grandson and he absolutely loves it,20
i bought this tablet for my two yr old granddaughter for christmas and she loves the games and camera works great glad i got it for her,20
so i was skeptical of echo show and the entire line to be honest however this technology has changed how our household operates from my daily briefing in the morning to tracking santa with my year old every morning learning interesting facts about santa and several other things i truly wish i would have bought this sooner we have it integrated into our cozi account so we can just ask alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in we also have adt pulse and a nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple i couldn t believe it my son loves to ask alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is i am loving the amazon music now as well because we bought an echo dot just to integrate into our bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now if you are on the fence about getting the echo show like i was just do it it really is an amazing product,20
i bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters great item and just as nice as the more expensive one she absolutely loves it,20
my wife purchased this for my daughter great for learning to read,20
nice little tablet with great features bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book she also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on,20
purchased for my grandson he loves it when setting up be sure to update the software,20
i saw this product used by friends and was so impressed i bought one for my husband for christmas,20
amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up,20
once the games are downloaded it was great for long road trips,20
can use many differents apps from the echo show awesome product,20
i had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things the extra ram makes a difference very happy and if you re a prime member there are lots of freebies,20
has built in smart hub unlike other echos works with other smart home devices with no additional purchases,20
my kids loved it they were able to learn how to use it right away,20
i purchased this kindle for my wife because her kindle fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the fire since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus the main drawback is that the graphics aren t as clear with this reader all in all it was money well spent,20
overall it is a good tablet but i am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and amazon app store,20
a great new amazon device to add to my other alexa products the visuals are amazing and it is so easy to use and set up,20
my niece and nephew are going to love this i got it for a great price too what a nice christmas present,20
i had my doubts when i first purchased it but after just a day i had synced it with my thermostat lights tv bose sound system and many more amazing product couldn t be happier,20
bought this kindle for my grandson he loves it and it very easy to use,20
bought for daughter in law and she likes it she wanted a fire,20
i love the capability to see it on the screen and it allows me to not have to use my hands,20
great product absolute love it alexa is fun to converse with and has a wealth of information,20
bought this kindle for my grandson he loves it and it very easy to use,20
looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened,20

i got this for my two grandsons ages for christmas they love them,20
haven t been able to train alexa like we ve heard probably our own fault we have fun with it,20
tablet works will with amazon video on our smart tvs as well as the firesticks,20
love alexa it works so well speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does,20
i enjoy my kindle immensely so much better than having to start up my computer,20
i purchased this kindle fire hd was purchased for use by and yer old grandchildren they basically use it to play amazon games that you download,20
great tablet for streaming good internet connection along with a nice display,20
too difficult to setup not compatible with other equipment,20
my children love these kindles they are so much better then the st ones we had the price is better as well,20
absolutely love the echo show it is in my kitchen i love seeing my to do and shopping lists on there my calendar is there too plus i scroll pictures on it from my amazon prime photos love being able to get the daily news briefing from mpr every morning also use it for timing things would highly recommend it to amazon prime members got it at a great price on sale prior to christmas,20

thank you great product for all ages thank you,20
i really enjoy the sound it sounds so full my only disappointment is the limited functionality of the built in hub i had to purchase the hue hub to get full functionality other than that i love it,20
love this tablet it does everything i need it to my problem is i have family that falls in love with it so i give mine away if this wasn t good i wouldn t be on my rd one the only thing i would change is the silly ads and even worse browser other than that a solid product,20
i love the functionality of this amazon tablet bought one for me and one for the hubby,20
setting up the amazon show was a little tricky but i managed to navigate through it it s so cool to add compatible equipment,20
bought of these for my and yr old and it said it came with gb storage but actual storage was a little less cant remember exactly how much probably around gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre installed they mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them there is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera love the product comes in different color as well i got the blue,20
i purchased two of these for my kids ages and forget the ipod touch for the price this tablet can t be beat they can download games books and movies for free all included with my amazon prime membership awesome,20
alexa has changed my life i now own alexas o,20
works very well easy to carry around connect to wifi,20

i love to use alexa to listen to music set timer alarms and ect my parents use the show to show the cameras and stuff for a second control panel to their security system,20
i decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and i do not regret my decision at all the only con for those evaluating this as a tablet is that amazon has their own app store many apps from googleplay appstore are simply not available,20
i love this this memory card the price was good ty,20
this fire worked great but i returned it because it was not the one i wantedbest buy took it back for a full refund with no problems best buy is alsome,20
hard to use and does not support guam online instructions not clear,20
my year old mom loves this she now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices loves to read do crosswords etc,20
gets use everyday by my girlfriend who i bought it for with no complaints also love the color also may get one for myself,20
this thing works great i would recommend to all of my friends should have bought one sooner we listen to music non stop now,20
i really enjoy the sound it sounds so full my only disappointment is the limited functionality of the built in hub i had to purchase the hue hub to get full functionality other than that i love it,20
this is my second kindle fire and i have been extremely pleased with them both this second one is much more versatile and i love it,20
we gave this tablet to our nine year old grandaughter for her birthday she loves it and we feel it is very sturdy that is a very good thing when it comes to tablets and children,20
it is so fun to talk to alexa the sound is also very high quality i am very happy with my purchase,20
nice upgrade from my old kindle i like it very much,20
i recently had purchased enough smart home devices to make this a good addition for the home it works well with smart outlets our ring doorbell and fairly well with our nest thermostat my only complaint is that sometimes for no reason it will start plying a movie trailer and it s hard to get it to stop still all in all we re happy with the purchase,20
got it for few weeks but it kind of fades away from your life,20
no problem other than setup took a few minutes to finish,20
bought as a gift for christmas they love it,20
amazon kindle fire has a lot of free app and can be used by any one that wants to get online anywhere,20
biting as a gift my only concern was the size and the amazon interface it was easy enough to download the google play store so it was familiar to the user size was an initial concern but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome,20
we love kindle fire we purchase it for an older couple and it s easy to work,20
i bought this tablet for my two yr old granddaughter for christmas and she loves the games and camera works great glad i got it for her,20
this has been an exceptional hit for us she totally loves it,20
i bought this as a gift for my daughter s nd birthday and she totally loved it now she s wanting me to buy a second one so that i can keep it on the first floor she says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other i think it was a great purchase so i think i m going to have to buy another one,20
small enough to carry every where when he is using it you can hear a pin drop,20
i wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format the fire meets my needs at a great price,20
i bought two of these for two of my children the parental controls are great and i can easily control their access to content the ability to make them do something educational like read for min before playing games is awesome this tablet does everything i wanted it to do,20
i ve bought several kindles for my grandkids they all enjoy them we use it for the library and download into overdrive and there are so many free games kids love this,20
this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s in but this is about cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s was not doing it for me,20
i bought this second kindle for the larger storage space and love all the extra stuff i can do now,20
my son really enjoys this its his first tablet he is and had no problem learning how to use it,20
absolutely love kindle kids edition easy to use great apps and love it comes with year warranty must have for my kids,20
i purchased two of these tablets as a gift for christmas it has an exceptional hd screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book articles etc,20
love my mine works great with prime and i have all my best movies,20
this is my th kindle and is easily the best one i ve ever had it is very comfortable to hold and is very compact i was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles it may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery,20
this item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing the only con is that amazon doesn t have some of the apps that google play has,20
bought it for my husband and he loves it this is perfect for what he wanted it for,20
easy to set up but it does not work with all phones i have samsung,20
already had and when these when bb had a big sale price i couldn t order it fast enough i can see my nest cameras another product make video calls to other show owners voice calls to anyone else except and a whole host of skills that are being added almost daily my only regret is not replacing my remaining echo dots when they were on sale i won t make that mistake on next big sale i also received of the other home assistants included as free bonuses for buying a couple of other things i thought that it was only fair to compare the two disregarging the video aspects of show amazon s shows and dots echos were like comparing lambourgini to a vw bug setting up these things are like the expression i heard as a kid easier than fallin of a log and not near as dangerous,20
as good as echo with added visuals can be usefuland fun,20
love my amazon echo show however i wish alexa knew a little bit more,20
i really like this device right now i only have light sync d with it but looking forward to adding more another feature i like is the ability to put items on both my shopping and errand lists i can t wait to find out all the things it can do for me,20
as always great job very easy to use and it s always with me only problem i have is the button on the bottom is touchy but not really an issue keep up the good work,20
i bought this for reading listening books love the availability to expand the memory now i can load movies and tons of books,20
whats to say it s kindlelishous,20
i purchased these tablets for my grandchildren after purchasing for another grandchild in october they love them and their parents love being able to dictate how they use them,20
great tablet for web access and works well gaming no reason to spend more unless you need a larger screen,20
bought for our son so he wouldn t have to carry books back from his deployment,20
a little more complicated than my original kindle but i like it,20
this is a nice little tablet for me since i don t do a lot on a tablet it s a great size it took a little getting use to working with but am a little more comfortable with it now,20
i love this and it s great for kids got it for a early christmas gift for a friends son and he loves it,20

the echo plus is a fantastically easy to use smarthome hub it is easy to setup fast and responsive has a ton of capabilities that are expanding daily and looks and sounds great i currently use mine to manage my smart things like light bulbs lamps smart switches and even my robot vac it has made automating a lot of what i do daily a breeze and has simplified my life where i didn t know it needed to be simplified definitely worth the extra money to go with the plus over the echo or the dot,20
great tablet and price ordering online easy not happy took so long to receive though,20
they are both responsive to each other and it gives me convenience i don t have to turn off the lights and all i do is lay down and ask alexa to turn off the light all my lights are connected to my echo plus,20
great tablet for streaming good internet connection along with a nice display,20
this is an awesome product this is the first echo product i owned and i purchased to get off i was going to split with a friend but like this so much that i decided to keep both i ve being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos the videos on youtube takes a more effort to find the ones i want but i think this will improve over time,20
i bought this for my grandson and it hasn t disappointed me at all he loves his tablet i am looking at buying his sister one next,20
i love this tablet i got one for each one of the kids all different ages and they all love it,20
amazon s devices get better and better each release i ve had the original kindle fire and it s in no way an apple ipad replacement but what it does it does better than anyone it s a perfect starter tablet and perfect for a child the price keeps you from worrying about drops and the interface is easy to use,20
we have bought two taps one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son we love the portability of the tap it s perfect for our deck our grandchildren love it too,20
i bought this as a gift for christmas and it was well liked,20
this is a fantastic item the person i bought it for loves it,20
this is a very good tablet the only con is you may have to reboot it too often,20
i bought this as a gift for my husband and he is constantly asking alexa questions about everything we love listening to music on it as well,20
love the new fire great for books games and getting online easy to use features and perfect size screen to take on the go,20
this thing works great i would recommend to all of my friends should have bought one sooner we listen to music non stop now,20
alexa has changed my life i now own alexas o,20
like it better then the nabi jr more like a real tablet actually it is with the extra protective case,20
i love my echo show i wish you could watch movies or tc shows or you tube so hopefully they will add that soon,20
my wife loves this tablet much easier to use than previous tablets that we purchased,20
we bought one of these for our year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a christmas present for a year old parent it obviously isn t the highest quality tablet on the market but it very responsive and gets the job done and you can t beat the price just a great value,20
purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year amazon membership the recipient loves it and says it performs very well as a past amazon fire user now i pad graduate i loved my amazon fire for more than years without any problems in fact i just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ,20
got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked cheaper than getting the screen replaced,20
love everything about my new tablet good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails,20
the echo plus is a fantastically easy to use smarthome hub it is easy to setup fast and responsive has a ton of capabilities that are expanding daily and looks and sounds great i currently use mine to manage my smart things like light bulbs lamps smart switches and even my robot vac it has made automating a lot of what i do daily a breeze and has simplified my life where i didn t know it needed to be simplified definitely worth the extra money to go with the plus over the echo or the dot,20
this kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach,20
fun product that can be used for many purposes great for streaming or reading on the go with great graphics makes an awesome gift,20
i love the alexa system of assistance this version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won t get to have to the option to pick up you need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private i installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use,20
my kid love this tablet the setup was so easy and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps that my kid can enjoy playing and learning,20
runs great very efficient for what we use it for,20
liked the first one so much i bought one for the wife,20
this is the main reason why i went with amazon s echo ecosystem vs google home i bought one as a gift to my sister so i can easily videochat with my family my niece and nephew tend to fight over the echo show when they want to sing along to their favorite songs with the lyrics on the screen my only wish was that there was an hdmi out to connect it to a larger monitor huge missed opportunity in my opinion,20
originally i bought this for my and year olds they loved it and so did i so many things to do on them and so much of what they love i now got it as well for my year old the best part of it all is the cases come with the tablets and they have colors to choose from so perfect for me,20
this is the only one you need it s like having the dot echo and ihome all in one with a screen,20
bought for my husband for christmas we keep it in our kitchen and mainly just use it for music but our kids love that they can tell alexa to play a song they like and it plays,20
i gave my paperwhite to a friend and bought the voyage i like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages i don t know that it s really worth all of the extra cost compared to the paperwhite especially since the new one just came out with dpi,20
we use alexa for so many things we use it for shopping list music lights on or off even trivia games,20
it works about of the time when asking it a question,20
very impressed set up a little confusing but overall a good experience still learning however best buy emails give away any gift secrets had to reset my account to a work email address,20
nice upgrade from my old kindle i like it very much,20
a great new amazon device to add to my other alexa products the visuals are amazing and it is so easy to use and set up,20
i enjoy alexa she reminds me of appointment and alerts me when my packages arrive,20
i purchase this tablet for my daughter s birthday and she absolutely loves it i am very pleased that she s not able to get online or to get on youtube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can t get into it i would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the google play store since it is an amazon tablet,20
this is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price i bought this when it is on sale for for gb sd card you have a great tablet when plenty of space i used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced this tablet is a deal,20
fun product that can be used for many purposes great for streaming or reading on the go with great graphics makes an awesome gift,20
purchased for my mom in a memory care center she doesn t have to answer the phone we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us picture clarity awesome staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently doesn t replace room camera but good would give a but can t figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her anyone know,20
i purchased two of these for my kids ages and forget the ipod touch for the price this tablet can t be beat they can download games books and movies for free all included with my amazon prime membership awesome,20
got it as a gift for my dad so far so good didn t not realise the special offers are ads spend more money to buy the one with out them also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection you now need wifi to connect to the store,20
i purchased two of these for my kids ages and forget the ipod touch for the price this tablet can t be beat they can download games books and movies for free all included with my amazon prime membership awesome,20
you need to have amazone prime in order to have music,20
thank you great product for all ages thank you,20
i wish i could just say it is one of my best investment i love the fact that now i don t have to drag around several of my favorite books i can now have them all in one convenient place the battery life is great my little girl loves that she can play games on it i think it s great i should have gotten more memory though,20
do you spend lots of time on amazon do you like listening to music anywhere in your home this is the device for you even after a month of having the tap i m still learning what all i can do with it verbally play genre of music in the huge amazon library i even have ordered items directly from it one last feature i want to share is that it provides accurate weather information current and forecast up to a week,20
bought this for all four of my children and they loved it,20
this was purchased for my older grandson age for christmas and as i stated in another review it has had games downloaded on it and will be ready to use when it is opened by him,20
the display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good probably better for reading than watching videos we didn t really get it for the games but there is a good selection wifi works well and internet browsing is fast,20
it was by far the best deal out there for the money very happy,20

can use many differents apps from the echo show awesome product,20
i bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop i thought this looked more user friendly since she knows my year old nephew can use an ipad,20
the kids love it they ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer i really like for the music aspect just tell it a song and it finds it,20
i upgraded to have more memory and this is a great little tablet works great and does everything i need it to do,20

great sound and amazing options love this great replacement for original echo,20
nice easy to use tablet we just got it and so far so good,20
can use many differents apps from the echo show awesome product,20
its a great product but for the cost the speakers are not what they should be and the screen is too small choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot i am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance,20
having fun with all the things we can learn from alexa it is almost like having another person in the house,20

the battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge i bought the fire in july and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it i am not impressed and would not repurchase it,20

the echo plus is a fantastically easy to use smarthome hub it is easy to setup fast and responsive has a ton of capabilities that are expanding daily and looks and sounds great i currently use mine to manage my smart things like light bulbs lamps smart switches and even my robot vac it has made automating a lot of what i do daily a breeze and has simplified my life where i didn t know it needed to be simplified definitely worth the extra money to go with the plus over the echo or the dot,20
this is my first tablet love it actually read my first e book on it large screen easy to read play games fits nicely in my purse,20
i am loving my amazon echo show it makes life easier i love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking alexa i also love being able to video call friends and family that have an echo show or the alexa app overall it is a great product,20
bought this mostly as a backup and to read a few books since i have a larger cell phone and a back up used it occasionally may or hours of use till this week when i sent my laptop in for repairs so i probably used it a tot this week i was watching my rd primetime video this week and it simply turned off it will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode it is gone it is toast bought it october it quit on february my old fire lasted or years with more use it had stereo speakers lasted a week on a charge not or days sturdier built this is full of junk i am not just offered more apps it is constantly trying to add them junk junk junk,20
alexa makes my life easy by turning my lights on and off playing my favorite music and so much more it really can control anything,20
i like being able to ask about the weather set an alarm on my phone or create a shopping list all by just asking elexia,20
i am enjoying my kindle very much easy to down load books and easy to read very happy with my purchase,20
exchanged the google google home for this model fun for the kids finding new uses for it every day had a problem when best buy forgot to include the free light bulb,20

great tablet and price ordering online easy not happy took so long to receive though,20

the built in hue allows the echo plus to automatically search and finds connectable devices the larger speaker area assists in better sound and the alexa to hear my voice,20
bought of these for my and yr old and it said it came with gb storage but actual storage was a little less cant remember exactly how much probably around gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre installed they mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them there is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera love the product comes in different color as well i got the blue,20

great buy after owning the original kindle fire it s very versatile and shows the progress made from the original you can t lose and pair it with amazon prime,20
i don t recommend buying this after month of buying this it won t charge or turn on,20
my only dislike is that being a kindle my kindle books cannot be sorted into categories it s harder to find new books i ve downloaded some time ago when i have to search through all of them,20
i bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips,20

i bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire so far it has exceeded my expectations all my apps have transferred flawlessly the battery lasts me hours with moderate internet use glad i made this purchase,20
i have bought the cheaper tablets for my kids in the past however the sales associate recommend this tablet and it was only dollars more so far i am really impressed by the difference in quality,20
nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity,20
replacement tablet for my wife no complaints she watches netflix on it a lot,20
i got this for my two grandsons ages for christmas they love them,20
definitely worth the money the sound is awesome,20
alexa walks you through every step which i found helpful,20
fantastic sound from such a small speaker excellent not as impressed with its other potential capabilities more difficult to set those up get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather order items etc wish it came with more pre installed i guess,20
i absolutely love my kindle i go nowhere without it it has kept me entertained for hours don t have to keep up with books that get torn or lost i would and do recommend a kindle for everyone,20
amazon kindle is always the best ebook upgrade every new model,20
i was resistant to putting down my real books and begin using a kindle i m so glad i did it s so convenient to shop and instantly download a book plus no more storing hundreds on books in my house,20
we love the parent controls and durability we would definitely buy another,20
bought for my husband for christmas we keep it in our kitchen and mainly just use it for music but our kids love that they can tell alexa to play a song they like and it plays,20
i bought this tablet for my year old grand daughter and she loves it we set the parental controls for her age group and now we don t have to worry about what she is doing on it we downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it and now she has her own little private movie theater it also works great with our amazon fire tv and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows this is a great buy for the money and i recommend it to everyone,20
fantastic product and does exactly as described great gift idea,20
i got to say that love it makes it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my needs,20
great inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps,20
this kindle fire blows away my other tablet for performance battery life readability color and many other options i love this size as well,20
the kindle is amazing this is my second one the price was misleading however as i had to pay something like another extra bucks to get rid of the ads just know that,20
not sure why but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it very disappointing,20
the battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge i bought the fire in july and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it i am not impressed and would not repurchase it,20
i bought this after i bought the amazon echo this was actually an impulse buy i saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it because i enjoyed the echo so much it does everything the echo does but the sound quality is not great when you re playing at middle volume it s ok the lows are there but doesn t sound good i m guessing i m comparing it with the bose mini soundlink when you set the volume high the bass is almost non existent the mids and highs are loud with the louder volume another difference is that with tap you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands i do like the fact that it s portable because of that i m on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass,20
this tablet has many educational games for a preschooler,20
i purchased a kindle a few years ago and have loved the flexibility it give me i can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer i love the fact that i can continue to read my books while i travel doctor office visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because i can ignore the office chatter and the tv selections i rather not watch i encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that this is my second purchase love it,20
great product loving alexa was so happy with it that know its a big part of all that i do,20
bought this for my daughter to use in school she loves it product works great i also bought the older version for my mom and she lives it as well,20
my daughter absolutely love her tablet and i love it to for her it s very kids friendly,20
i didn t think i would like the echo show especially at the price point but i tried it and love it if i could afford it and if they would add an audio port i would replace my current alexas with echo shows,20
i can see my grandchildren when i call it is a great machine,20
the show is a great little product it has opened a lot of doors in the world of ai and home automation for me it connected easily with my echo and dot and now i can stream music all over my house the picture quality is outstanding the only drawback is that alexa doesn t have a very strong internet search engine,20
bought this for all four of my children and they loved it,20
this replaced my old kindle fire i have not yet explored all of the features but so far it is performing very well tablet is a good size and weight and easy to use,20
this was a christmas present for the nephew works good he loves it,20
enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do initially disappointed by the small size but i quickly learned to appreciate it very portable and convenient i wanted something easy on the eyes with a g connection so i did not have to be connected to wifi to download books was a bit more then i wanted to pay but feel i will get good use out of it,20
it very convenient it small and it work awesome can put in my purse or,20
bought for my kids and they love them they love the camera,20
i purchased this kindle for my wife because her kindle fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the fire since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus the main drawback is that the graphics aren t as clear with this reader all in all it was money well spent,20
i bought the white version and have it in the kitchen i use it for everything music video phone security cams news weather it s the perfect kitchen assistant,20
no instructions on adding the memory card and how to move things to the card vs on internally,20
this is a great tablet for kids and adults alike,20
this was a gift for christmas we bought this on a black friday sale price was reasonable,20
my daughter loves her kindle and it s larger than the previous one she had she enjoys it,20
the family and i love alexa view and once we got it we were hooked now everything in the house and outside is run by voice commands the opportunities with this are endless,20
has built in smart hub unlike other echos works with other smart home devices with no additional purchases,20
amazon kindle is always the best ebook upgrade every new model,20
i think the amazon fire offer should include a stand cover as standard i enjoy mine a lot more since i was forced to purchase a stand cover which holds the tablet would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use,20
i already have amazon devices echo s and dot s i expected this device to be slightly different as it is the only amazon device i have with a screen i was pleasantly surprised at the large number of helpful features that a screen could bring it occasionally scrolls suggestions across the screen and most of them have been very helpful i m planning on setting another one up at my year old mothers house she ll get a kick out of it also,20
brought it for my son does exactly what i want it to do,20
i bought my step mom an updated kindle she reads the new kindle more than her old one,20

this was a purchase for christmas great tablet to surf the web or read books on would recommend for any age,20
the built in hue allows the echo plus to automatically search and finds connectable devices the larger speaker area assists in better sound and the alexa to hear my voice,20
our whole family loves and uses this device for so many different features we love using it to make phone calls watch films play jeopardy even to define words as they come up in conversation we definitely get a lot of use out of this device more than any other screen tablet or smart phone device we own,20

excellent product turns on and off supported devices by asking it live walking into a room and asking alexa to turn on a light poof it s done or locking and unlocking the front door arming and disarming my security system if you re looking to turn your house into a smarthome i strongly recommend the amazon echo plus,20

we were interested in the echo line of products after we purchased our vivint security system the echo show is a perfect addition we are able to view our security cameras from the the echo show and it works great in general as an echo with all its features,20
we brought this as a replacement for the fifteen to fifty books my daughter wanted to take with her to hawaii books of course would weigh a lot and there be no room for cloths pesky airline and their poundage issues now she can take a hundred books and she has a mini computer it s a win win but no win for the airlines,20
i love the alexa system of assistance this version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won t get to have to the option to pick up you need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private i installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use,20
added screen a great features visual effect a plus,20
fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything,20
i enjoy alexa she reminds me of appointment and alerts me when my packages arrive,20
looks nice can t wait to try it out great price for a tablet,20
love my kindle at the price it is the best value in tech right now,20
this has been a very nice addition it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it,20
gift for great nephew have that are and y o both love these tablets because each got one play with them as much as mom allows,20
i loved this tablet i did but i did not love that i was being sold ads every time i powered up i loathe even more that i would have had to pay to discontinue that feature amazon if you want dollars for the kindle fire charge it but don t under price the device and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity it is unbecoming of you i returned this item pronto,20
this is great for kids it grows up with them all the apps are good my kid loves it,20
bought this for my teenage daughter and it works beautifully with great battery life,20
it was amazing everything was perfect and it came on time,20
i use mine for email facebook games and to go on line i also have down loaded books i use it to take photos it is small and be taken easily i would recommend it to anyone,20
amazon kindle is always the best ebook upgrade every new model,20
my wife s old kindle stopped holding a charge so to surprise her i stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle this kindle is great its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life my wife uses it every day this is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget,20
i bought this for my mom and she loves it she said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting it s easy for her to read,20
this has quickly become one of the most used at the kitchen counter if you have alexa an you like it a must have upgrade,20
i was reluctant to purchase the echo plus and my best friend said to do it you will love it i did and she was so right the philips hue light bulb was an added bonus and love that too,20
i thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm i think it is too small to read on it not very comfortable as regular kindle would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead,20
i bought this as a gift for my daughter s nd birthday and she totally loved it now she s wanting me to buy a second one so that i can keep it on the first floor she says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other i think it was a great purchase so i think i m going to have to buy another one,20
great inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps,20
purchased this for my wife during christmas and got a great deal on it compared to the older version that she has this model is faster brighter and more convenient with alexa i would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it,20
she love it she said it easy to use she love it very much,20
upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras sound is much better,20
i ve had lots of tablets in the past mostly from the samsung line but this is my first amazon fire so i want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these at the time that this was written alexa had not been added to the tablet first while this device runs an android type of operating system amazon puts its own spin on the operating system i don t feel like i m using android this feels different to me it doesn t have the same level of customization that android users have come to appreciate that being said if you are an amazon prime member this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine it s simply a fun way to consume your magazines books etc there are on screen buttons on the bottom of the device the middle button immediately takes you to your home screen the button to the left acts as a sort of back button it also lets me get rid of my keyboard when i don t need it on screen but it s open the button to the right is super important it took me a couple of days to realize what it does that square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open it lets you switch between apps but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out you can close them by pressing the x button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right if you leave all of those apps open and you never close them you ll drain your battery make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps the device has several menus that you swipe left to view first you start with your home screen you literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet all of your apps are housed here you swipe up to view all of them the tablet comes with several apps pre installed such as slik amazon s own internet browser audible good reads the amazon app store a weather app etc you can go to the amazon app store to download other apps such as twitter facebook etc you can combine the apps on this page into folders you just drag one app to another app and a folder appears this made my home screen much more manageable you can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings this feature doesn t necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps however i believe it only changes the font on your main screens if you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device when you have a new issues it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of new items the device comes with a free month subscription to the washington post you ll see that under new items when you initially activate your tablet you can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos you can do this through the settings menu on the device if you want to use one of your own photos however you need to either take it on the device or move it into amazon s photos app which is a cloud based app so far i haven t found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper i m not crazy about the amazon photo app i found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into amazon s cloud just so i could view them on my tablet that being said i m not planning to take photos on this device i just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper beyond the home screen you can swipe to the right to view your other screen they are pre arranged to be books videos games shop apps music audiobooks and newstand all of those screens are connected to your amazon account for example if you have kindle books you ve already purchased they automatically will appear under the books menu your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu there doesn t seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages that bugs me but it s not the end of the world there s also one menu to the left of the home menu it s the recent page it shows you what you ve received looked at on the tablet i never use it but it might be handy for some people one of my favorite features of this tablet is amazon s on deck capability if you re an amazon prime member amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like the items don t count against your pre installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full you can turn off the on deck feature if you don t like it i ve been content with the video playback capability this isn t my major use of the device but the images look fine and the audio is ok i ll talk more about the speakers later my other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the newstand i ve tried magazines on here and they all look gorgeous now i can always have my magazines with me so if i m stuck at the airport or at the doctor s office i always have them one of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free i just had to connect my account to the device this allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as i ve had an account my other magazine didn t include a digital edition so i canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version it was an inexpensive magazine anyway there are several magazines that you can try free for days on the device i did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure the kindle fire doesn t come with the google play store installed you can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty you can google to find the instructions to do this it s not difficult to do if you re fairly comfortable with technology it probably took me minutes most of the apps i wanted were in the amazon store but there were a handful that i had paid for through google play the only way i could have them was to go back to access that store they have worked fine so far i despise the keyboard that amazon pre installed on this device there are no lines between the letters on the keyboard i suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys but i hate it i fixed that problem by going to google play and downloading a new keyboard it was a pretty easy problem to solve so i can t complain apps that are connecting to the internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets but that generally doesn t bother me if you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop however that might drive you crazy the screen on this device isn t bad if i compare it to my fancy phone it s not as shape but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone the screen is outstanding the speakers are ok there are two of them located on the bottom of the screen i won t say that they are fantastic they aren t in my opinion they are fine for watching youtube or a television show they are not ok for listening to music if you are an audiophile you can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre install app but still your music will sound tinny that being said you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker use a pair of headphones etc this device wasn t made for taking pictures it has a front and back camera but they aren t designed to be spectacular i m not using them i find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands i think that s partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick also i do have some hand problems similar to someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome i think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives i m still waiting for it i m greatly enjoying this device it s simply fun to use the tablet there are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use amazon services if you don t typically use amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the internet and you re looking for a low price tag this device may be ok for you,20
we bought one of these for our year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a christmas present for a year old parent it obviously isn t the highest quality tablet on the market but it very responsive and gets the job done and you can t beat the price just a great value,20
it is nice to have access to the features this offers,20
i bought the kindle oasis for my wife as a th anniversary gift she enjoys reading and i thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice she tried it for a few days and didn t care for it she writes notes in the margins and wasn t happy with the way the kindle did its notes for just reading i think it would be a very nice product,20
i love hear readers i had to replace mine because i destroyed the last but it is awesome,20
no problems so far i m enjoying it suggestion it should come with some outputs plugs to connect it to bigger speakers sound system,20
i love the cameras and the video capabilities i have set up the picture albums and can even share on facebook and messenger i like the side charger much better than front i love the size too,20
i m still learning what all i can do with this device but i am continually amazed at it s capabilities i love playing with it and learning from it when doing other things i have tap playing music i love this thing,20
i never used kindle before my wife gifted me on my birthday this is the amazing product i am using it for daily reading the display is fantastic and no strain on eyes,20
bought of these for my and yr old and it said it came with gb storage but actual storage was a little less cant remember exactly how much probably around gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre installed they mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them there is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera love the product comes in different color as well i got the blue,20
i like being able to ask about the weather set an alarm on my phone or create a shopping list all by just asking elexia,20
great notepad huge screen and easily downloaded apps to use love it,20
my son wanted a tablet just for his books we looked at e readers and tablets this was so much better and the price was perfect,20
i bought two of these for my granddaughters and they are very easy to use and they love them,20
great overall would be nice to have parental controls though,20
limited apps and a bit thicker than ipad but works,20
bought if for my year old son has plenty of space long battery life it s durable and hasn t broke when dropped i m going to buy a case though,20
i am using it for my year old and she loves it,20
great product for when you are on the go great sound,20
my kiddo loves this tablet she s and knows how to work it well i look at it sometimes and see apps that i didn t download lol good thing first year is free it s very durable as well great product overall i would ve liked a different color for her but blue was all that was in stock and i got it a great price being on sale plus i had certificates to use,20
thank you great product for all ages thank you,20
purchased for my husband but this is more a gift for the entire family luv the display,20
love my amazon echo show however i wish alexa knew a little bit more,20
i was reluctant to purchase the echo plus and my best friend said to do it you will love it i did and she was so right the philips hue light bulb was an added bonus and love that too,20
i bought several alexa s for christmas gifts also for myself also bought amazon show for christmas gift also for a my youngest daugter,20
my wife loves this tablet much easier to use than previous tablets that we purchased,20
this is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price i bought this when it is on sale for for gb sd card you have a great tablet when plenty of space i used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced this tablet is a deal,20
this is my eighth kindle some others were either lost or screen damaged i bought it as a spare current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen great price also wish i d bought two,20
my kid loves this it was one of his favorite christmas presents,20
great choice battery life outstanding many kid friendly features,20
this is not like other android tablets in a bad way,20
echo show not only plays your music it puts up the lyrics to read from,20
bought if for my year old son has plenty of space long battery life it s durable and hasn t broke when dropped i m going to buy a case though,20
i love my amazon fire hd it s not too small and not too big i was looking at other tablets and decided on the amazon fire hd because of the price and because i have amazon prime i purchased it online at best buy and then picked it up at the store on black friday it is my first tablet and so i wanted to start with one that i can have fun with and i am i do have a laptop for important things,20
this little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming my kids have quickly learned that alexa is their personal dj when hooked up to the amazon prime unlimited music program battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass but it does the job for our family,20
i have always been a nook customer but recently their models have not received good feedback so while shopping for a new ereader i had to make the decision between the two the biggest influence behind price while the new samsung model of the nook definitely looks great it also has a big price tag overall we are very happy with this purchase it is mostly used as an ereader but we have downloaded a few games kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader,20
very nice people and good product i would buy from again,20
i was given a fire when i was recuperating from spine surgery a few years ago i used it for everything for quite some time this one has a camera and plays all the latest files i still have and use the old one as well an excellent content delivery system i got it with best buy customer appreciation money what a deal,20
great tablet perfect for my year old son,20
quite an upgrade from the original fire the deletion of the carousel was a welcome change the new turn style approach is faster and more consice still don t know why a chime sounds also miss the ease of making notes while reading there has got to be a better way to organize books trying to figure out series trilogies etc is impossible and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that amazon won t pick up a new purchase as a book already read,20
my grandson really enjoys his new kindle that he for for a christmas present,20
i have an old kindle touch the last one that still had text to voice which no longer works i decided to upgrade started reading the reviews was enticed by the the kindle voyage and took the plunge the voyage is pretty and sleek with neat features and i enjoyed using it for a few days but my frugal self just couldn t justify the price difference between it and the paperwhite while the ambient light sensor was nice i often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room i made more errors of turning a page than i meant to with the page turn because of where the page turn spots are located plus i m in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet so i kept swiping despite the availability of page turn however the clarity of the screen the quality of the light the form factor the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice nonetheless the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the paperwhite the thing i miss most about the voyage is the quality of the light and how even the lighting is on it the unit i had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the voyage i purchased the newest model of the paperwhite and i like it but the lighting appears pretty dingy however it s only when they re compared side to side that i wished i wasn t so cost conscious if money is not an object i d say get the kindle voyage if it is the paperwhite is a fine little reader and overall i m happy i have it,20
i love the internet tweeting and facebook no computers can complete me my kindle takes care of all my needs juju,20
it s a nice upgrade from the screen size is just right for small kids hands reading kindle books is much easier,20
i bought it xmas for my yr old who always wants our iphones to watch utube videos it s cool looking and well made plus alexa is helpful it she still prefers our iphones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive i like it but don t live it,20
my only dislike is that being a kindle my kindle books cannot be sorted into categories it s harder to find new books i ve downloaded some time ago when i have to search through all of them,20
bought this for my year old grandson who s a bit rough but loves to play games and read he loves it,20
i bought this for my mom and she loves it she said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting it s easy for her to read,20
everything i expected with none of the drawbacks i have found in other tablets,20
great tablet and price ordering online easy not happy took so long to receive though,20
love everything about my new tablet good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails,20
our daughter loves her new tablet it has a bigger screen more features and she just enjoys being on it the kindle is priced right and is easy to use she was able to get her apps transferred to her new tablet in no time great investment,20
i like this ereader it is a little small but you can increase the font,20
this was a christmas present for my niece she loved it,20
got it for few weeks but it kind of fades away from your life,20
it is good to have this as a backup lags performance eventually not worth for the money,20
i bought this for my month old daughter and she has already learned how to use it what a great way to keep her busy and quiet at the same time thanks,20
for those that have prime this is almost a must have keeps all your amazon stuff in one place,20
i love this tablet for kids it s so much fun for them great buy,20
i have an original gen echo that has been relocated to my bedroom by simply unplugging and plugging back in now that i have the gen echo plus in my living room and set up to work seamlessly with my gen i could not be happier along with the built in hue it makes it that much better everything works just like i want and the sound on both devices are perfect for me,20
i love to read books books books and more books,20
information on weather updates on music events fun questions answered while working in kitchen good sound for a limited areagreat sales assistance at best buy,20
bought the echo first and liked it so much i bought a tap to add mobility i carry it around all the time to the garage working out etc,20
this was a christmas present for the nephew works good he loves it,20
i loved this tablet i did but i did not love that i was being sold ads every time i powered up i loathe even more that i would have had to pay to discontinue that feature amazon if you want dollars for the kindle fire charge it but don t under price the device and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity it is unbecoming of you i returned this item pronto,20
amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far the only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don t have to tap every command that would make it a star device,20
excellent speaker love the portability and long lasting battery before a recharge is needed a very good digital assistant and lots of fun to use,20
product is good light amazing battery backup i charge the kindle one in weeks great product for reasonable price usb connection is easy books are easy to download overall everyone must have kindle with them and this is the best product model to start with understandably this is the beginner level model for people who never used kindle before features like led lights white paper background are not available on this model these features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in dark without lights but again for this price you would not get any other good readers if you are someone who reads in dark then i would suggest go for higher kindle models,20
can use many differents apps from the echo show awesome product,20
the amazon tap is a perfect complement to our amazon echo put this in our office space has all the advantages of the echo and is also a great bluetooth speaker having to tap the mic button to summon alexa is no issue at all sound quality is as good as any bluetooth speaker on the market and it s extremely portable,20
too difficult to setup not compatible with other equipment,20
great product that a whole family would enjoy it s a perfect addition to the household,20
we got this for the whole family and we are absolutely love the alexa speaker,20
it is a solid product great for kids i like it a lot,20
this is a great tablet because of all the preloaded games and ability to add more for free it keeps my kids entertained and is the best for learning,20
i bought this tablet for my year old grand daughter and she loves it we set the parental controls for her age group and now we don t have to worry about what she is doing on it we downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it and now she has her own little private movie theater it also works great with our amazon fire tv and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows this is a great buy for the money and i recommend it to everyone,20
great price great product would recommend this gift,20
amazon echo show is the best of all my amazon products i love the hands free but able to see things on the screen,20
we bought three including one for my year old we all love it the only complaint is the volume there is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers it doesn t bother us too much but that s why we give it stars overall a great tablet,20
already have the echo and dot has good sound quality and with the hub feature you can control the hue lights with alexa which is convenient when walking in the house with a bunch of groceries,20
i picked this up after purchasing an echo i wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my echo i use both devices mostly for music it s great to be able to hear pandora or my amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone laptop etc i can just grab the tap and go anywhere in my house outside to the deck anywhere that i my wireless will reach,20
the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs it works well as promised,20
gift for great nephew have that are and y o both love these tablets because each got one play with them as much as mom allows,20
the apps are better it charges faster and the camera is really neat,20
i ve love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area that is what i got and more i very satisfied except it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and i am back to satisfaction,20
i bought the white version and have it in the kitchen i use it for everything music video phone security cams news weather it s the perfect kitchen assistant,20
we love alexa great addition to our family lol but seriously you can rely on alexa,20
works great can t wait to find all it can do for me,20
love everything about my new tablet good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails,20
i love the cameras and the video capabilities i have set up the picture albums and can even share on facebook and messenger i like the side charger much better than front i love the size too,20
is good for the kids the only thing is i have to get a sd card for more memory,20
bought this tablet for my grandson and we couldn t be happier he loves it and it is easy to use created the children s account so he wouldn t be distracted by all the other goings on the internet bought this so he could play games do his school work as it links up nicely to the ixl and google class love the usage timer and the ability to lock it down i have loaded the google play store on it so we now access to many games and other apps no issues so far great buy for the money only down side i can see or in this case hear so far low sounding speaker could be a bit louder or better placed all in all you wont be disappointed in this purchase great for web page looks ups reading and playing games,20
this tablet is not only a great price but exactly what i needed for quick internet access and to download books,20
my daughter absolutely love her tablet and i love it to for her it s very kids friendly,20
fun product that can be used for many purposes great for streaming or reading on the go with great graphics makes an awesome gift,20
we bought one of these for our year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a christmas present for a year old parent it obviously isn t the highest quality tablet on the market but it very responsive and gets the job done and you can t beat the price just a great value,20
enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do initially disappointed by the small size but i quickly learned to appreciate it very portable and convenient i wanted something easy on the eyes with a g connection so i did not have to be connected to wifi to download books was a bit more then i wanted to pay but feel i will get good use out of it,20
got it as a gift for my dad so far so good didn t not realise the special offers are ads spend more money to buy the one with out them also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection you now need wifi to connect to the store,20
we love the parent controls and durability we would definitely buy another,20
good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn,20
the tablet is pretty good i would give it stars if you are able to download an use apps from the google store that is one of my only big complaint and also how fast the sd card got filled with items from amazon os that s on the tablet without the user knowing on the other hand with four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful,20
great tablet for streaming good internet connection along with a nice display,20
the kids will have a lot of fun time with games and learning,20
easy to set up but it does not work with all phones i have samsung,20
i love this this memory card the price was good ty,20
i bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop i thought this looked more user friendly since she knows my year old nephew can use an ipad,20
i bought this for learning and entertaining purposes my daughter is enjoys it i compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price protection plan this works best for us,20
i m an amazon prime member and the show is awsum i use it to communicate with the son who lives in seattle you can watch amazon pirime tv play amazon music text play games read the lyrics while the song is playing i love it,20
best kindle charger ever took minutes to being my kindle back to life,20
just a simple kindle doesn t have the glass back,20
i purchased these tablets for my grandchildren after purchasing for another grandchild in october they love them and their parents love being able to dictate how they use them,20
this tablet is great i loved the color and all the features it has i will be buying more for my daughters great purchase,20
i didn t think i would like the echo show especially at the price point but i tried it and love it if i could afford it and if they would add an audio port i would replace my current alexas with echo shows,20
my son is constantly distracted and loves technology him being only two years old this proved to be the perfect thing to keep him occupied and out of trouble,20
i got the first version for my sister and she hasn t been able to put it down on over a year then i got her this one and forget about it great new features she loves loves loves it,20
i love the cameras and the video capabilities i have set up the picture albums and can even share on facebook and messenger i like the side charger much better than front i love the size too,20
i lie the size and weight for the kindle makes it very convenient to take large books with me in digital format,20
alexa works great but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up,20
purchased for an year old that wanted this badly appears to be rugged links up with my amazon account for content and access year warranty win,20
the color is what got me and the features was on point the screen shows a lot of different displays to share for now until the next one,20
good tablet gave as gift and person enjoys it recommend,20
this a great tablet for everyone plenty of memory for downloading great features all around,20
i bought this as a backup i am currently using the same headphone,20
i bought both of my children one of these tablets they love it,20
i bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints,20
i like that the tablet has child settings and time usage very helpful in setting time limits,20
this is a great tablet for the price amazon is doing a good job,20
i bought this for my mom she enjoys checking her email and facebook she enjoys playing games most of all,20
i bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire so far it has exceeded my expectations all my apps have transferred flawlessly the battery lasts me hours with moderate internet use glad i made this purchase,20
amazon built upon the success of their echo i m really enjoying the convenience of the echo with the added display,20
i thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm i think it is too small to read on it not very comfortable as regular kindle would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead,20
works well worth the price good quality product have not had a problem,20
i was using the original echo seldomly then i decided to get the show i use the show a lot more was simple to set up and you can make calls with video great product,20
we returned it could not give answers to our questions even though the answers were easily found on google,20
i purchased this kindle for my wife because her kindle fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the fire since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus the main drawback is that the graphics aren t as clear with this reader all in all it was money well spent,20
bought this tablet on sale i can look up all the things i m interested in,20
fantastic product and does exactly as described great gift idea,20
i purchased this for my and year old grandchildren they were using parents phones and running the battery down now they have their own device and can watch their cartoons and play games love the case it makes it easy for little hands to hold on to overall very good purchase,20
purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year amazon membership the recipient loves it and says it performs very well as a past amazon fire user now i pad graduate i loved my amazon fire for more than years without any problems in fact i just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ,20
i bought several alexa s for christmas gifts also for myself also bought amazon show for christmas gift also for a my youngest daugter,20
this tablet works well for surfing the internet and playing music,20
i love it it does so much and is so easy to use i use it mostly for music and questions,20
echo show not only plays your music it puts up the lyrics to read from,20
the kindle is great for just reading books and the battery power is pretty good the experimental browser is not very user friendly,20
purchased for my grandson he loves it when setting up be sure to update the software,20
with this you can make calls to other echo shows or using the app you can call others that have the a show i haven t used this feature yet since i m the only one i know who has one i can tell you that while using the app at home or away from home off the network you can call the show i did this while at work to check it out and caught my son coming in the back door i freaked him out but after he settled down we chatted via video chat for awhile and both agreed it was awesome you could also just drop into the show from the app to check on the house or whatever wherever you have it keep in mind you re only gonna see what it s pointed at the camera doesn t move plus in its natural form it is tilted back slightly so it point upward there are stands on amazon the correct the tilt to make it straight up and down almost forgot but the speakers are amazing you can link multiple echos together to play music i have the show in my living room an echo in my bedroom and the dot connected to a jbl speaker in another room after set up through the app i can tell alexa to play music and they all come to life,20
i ve enjoyed using my fire hd tablet to play games,20
i received an original echo two years ago and use it in my office this year i decided to get one for the house and was amazed at all the features i hadn t taken advantage of primarily the smart home features this was great because it came with a lightbulb,20
this is actually for a gift second one i purchased but great priduct,20
we replaced and aging fire hdx she noticed the wifi connection is improved and the screen is larger she prefers this to my ipad air,20
i love being able to use alexa she is an amazing ai until the robots rebel against the human kind i think it s worth it,20
this is not like other android tablets in a bad way,20
this item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing the only con is that amazon doesn t have some of the apps that google play has,20
bought this for my year old grandson who s a bit rough but loves to play games and read he loves it,20
bought if for my year old son has plenty of space long battery life it s durable and hasn t broke when dropped i m going to buy a case though,20
best item i ever use i would love to get another one,20
i love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can t get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which i don t because i have a four and year old there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups,20
do you spend lots of time on amazon do you like listening to music anywhere in your home this is the device for you even after a month of having the tap i m still learning what all i can do with it verbally play genre of music in the huge amazon library i even have ordered items directly from it one last feature i want to share is that it provides accurate weather information current and forecast up to a week,20
powerful and quality sound love the portability just don t understand why this one can t read my notifications while the dot can,20
i ve had other kindles and when my current ones storage became low i knew i wanted to purchase another one it can be used for a variety of uses,20
i bought two of these for my granddaughters and they are very easy to use and they love them,20
this device meets the needs of my grandson he can read and play games on it it also has the parental safeguards,20
i got this for my two grandsons ages for christmas they love them,20
i talk myself into the g and i am so glad i did i have used only kindles for the past years and i love them i love the color as well,20
i like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k,20
the echo plus is a fantastically easy to use smarthome hub it is easy to setup fast and responsive has a ton of capabilities that are expanding daily and looks and sounds great i currently use mine to manage my smart things like light bulbs lamps smart switches and even my robot vac it has made automating a lot of what i do daily a breeze and has simplified my life where i didn t know it needed to be simplified definitely worth the extra money to go with the plus over the echo or the dot,20
the tablet is pretty good i would give it stars if you are able to download an use apps from the google store that is one of my only big complaint and also how fast the sd card got filled with items from amazon os that s on the tablet without the user knowing on the other hand with four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful,20
really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter learning i do wish it had more storage and more items for kids but we do love the tablet,20
i thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm i think it is too small to read on it not very comfortable as regular kindle would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead,20
i like the visual with this echo although i think i would have enjoyed it more if this was my first and only alexa,20
this product is amazing i wasn t quite sure why everyone was going on and on about having one but now that it s in my house i cannot imagine life without it alexa not only answers my questions and gives me valuable information but now she controls the lights of my house for me i highly recommend this,20
absolutely love the echo show it is in my kitchen i love seeing my to do and shopping lists on there my calendar is there too plus i scroll pictures on it from my amazon prime photos love being able to get the daily news briefing from mpr every morning also use it for timing things would highly recommend it to amazon prime members got it at a great price on sale prior to christmas,20
through all of my research this was the best value for what i was looking for in an e reader with additional options i was not sure i would use or not turns i do because of the ease of usage,20
good tablet for a yr old at first was not interested and still not but bought in in case and maybe one day if they decided to use it on a road trip good product for the price,20
i bought this for my daughter it s a little limited in what it can do but she loves it she s a little too young to understand the games but she loves watching cartoons on it,20
this is the best device i have found for my e books i know it can be used for a lot more but it is my library in my hand,20
got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked cheaper than getting the screen replaced,20
i bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters great item and just as nice as the more expensive one she absolutely loves it,20
i m loving this new fire mainly because i didn t fork out a couple hundred for it my only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an ipad so don t look great on this,20
i just love every thing about it its awesome to read,20
great product but the only downside is that it did not work with my home security camera,20
i love the alexa system of assistance this version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won t get to have to the option to pick up you need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private i installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use,20
very satisfied with product as do my family kids,20
this is my third kindle the best differentiator is the form factor definite improvement over the paperwhite also like having the page turn buttons back case is very cool indeed if you can get past the jump in price remember you re not having to buy the case separately it s a quality product to have,20
this is the best device i have found for my e books i know it can be used for a lot more but it is my library in my hand,20
i like my show but i can t say i love it for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices it has probably the worst microphone getting it to respond is frustrating at times where i have no problem with a standard echo besides this it all works as advertised i d wait for the second generation i m sure they can work the kinks out,20
great product i m at the beginning stages of having a smart home and this was the perfect addition,20
durable worth every penny got it for our year old daughter amazed how easily she can navigate it,20
i love to read books books books and more books,20
good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn,20
i bought this as a gift for my daughter s nd birthday and she totally loved it now she s wanting me to buy a second one so that i can keep it on the first floor she says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other i think it was a great purchase so i think i m going to have to buy another one,20
recently divorced i bought of these tonserve as homebase for me and my year old it has helped him to know there is one spot in both our houses he can reach me by simply saying drop on daddy,20
i bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips,20
this is the best assistant from amazon with the completion of the screen you can also see images from cameras and other devices simply awesome,20
got this for my year old granddaughter and she loves it uses it for game play homework etc mom and dad loves the parental controls not having to worry so much,20
using the kindle to read books and stream videos is very easy and enjoyable,20
bought a few kindles in the past but this time one of it came defective the port was bent and it was hard to charge but still possible comes in different color was gb enough space for kids has camera ok quality not the best but ok for pics taken by kids,20
got it as a gift for my dad so far so good didn t not realise the special offers are ads spend more money to buy the one with out them also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection you now need wifi to connect to the store,20
i ve had kindles for years and this latest one is also right up at the top,20
has been very durable with kids and easy to use great product for price,20
the color is what got me and the features was on point the screen shows a lot of different displays to share for now until the next one,20
i had my doubts when i first purchased it but after just a day i had synced it with my thermostat lights tv bose sound system and many more amazing product couldn t be happier,20
this is my third kindle second fire i use it constantly primarily for reading electronic books currently have over books in kindle library like it best when traveling as i don t have to carry a bunch of hardback books with me anywhere i go where i know there will be a waiting line haircut doctor s or dentist s office i have it with me and use it productively to read,20
seems a lot better does not have the open cover feature which i miss but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that i had on the old,20
we have always been nexus tablet desciples and in fact have bought of them for self and family members this one was for granddaughter to replace nexus that had gotten slow this one works better faster than the nexus it s fast easy to use perfect tablet for a child or teenager and can t beat the price very pleased with purchase,20
nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better,20
i like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports etc still not using it to its full potential but we have it controlling a couple of lamps giving us weather reports setting timers and alarms it s making me lazy sometimes it doesn t hear my voice hears my husband s voice better i find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table,20
this is a great tablet for kids and adults alike,20
we replaced and aging fire hdx she noticed the wifi connection is improved and the screen is larger she prefers this to my ipad air,20
love how user friendly the kindle fire is for any age,20
the new kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea,20
the kids will have a lot of fun time with games and learning,20
small enough to carry every where when he is using it you can hear a pin drop,20
i ve love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area that is what i got and more i very satisfied except it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and i am back to satisfaction,20
this has a lot of good features to limit the amount of time and what is accessed,20
this is a great tablet because of all the preloaded games and ability to add more for free it keeps my kids entertained and is the best for learning,20
my nd fire great picture quality easy to use would recommend for all ages,20
has everything you will ever need inside for children and adultsa,20
with a price tag of this is one of the low end tablets with a lot of features but is certainly worth its price tag but it definitely lacks the features and hd display of its high end variant fire hd,20
i would recommend this product it works great and ver compact,20
haven t been able to train alexa like we ve heard probably our own fault we have fun with it,20
we love this so much in our home we bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it they love watching their movies on it and playing different apps it is a really good value,20
it would be nice to have full app library but it does what you need,20
this is my third one of these and this is the best one by far,20
i wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick i ll get flowers next time,20
i bought of these for gifts i love my echo and think the new one will be incredible too after the holidays i will buy one for myself,20
this is a great tablet because of all the preloaded games and ability to add more for free it keeps my kids entertained and is the best for learning,20
my family love alexa and so happy not having to buy any cd or another radio again,20
got it as a gift for my dad so far so good didn t not realise the special offers are ads spend more money to buy the one with out them also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection you now need wifi to connect to the store,20
bought of these for my and yr old and it said it came with gb storage but actual storage was a little less cant remember exactly how much probably around gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre installed they mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them there is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera love the product comes in different color as well i got the blue,20
i bought this for my mom and she loves it she said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting it s easy for her to read,20
we bought three including one for my year old we all love it the only complaint is the volume there is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers it doesn t bother us too much but that s why we give it stars overall a great tablet,20
i like the visual with this echo although i think i would have enjoyed it more if this was my first and only alexa,20
i bought this as a backup i am currently using the same headphone,20
this is an awesome product i also own a paperwhite if you always read in good lighting i would recommend you save some money and buy this instead of the paperwhite,20
your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps videos and the internet you can not get a better deal the yr anything happens warranty is a big plus it s not the fastest thing on the market it s desent picture quality is great everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy love the fact that i can program it to have her read mins st before she can fully access it also that i can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week,20
this has kept my kids entertained but maybe just a little too entertained sadly they don t want to do much else,20
the amazon echo plus is good buy it buy it you will love it,20
purchased for my son who loves to read books saw him watching old tv show he sat down with me and showed me what all it could do who would figure i thought it was just for reading books now i want one too,20
your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps videos and the internet you can not get a better deal the yr anything happens warranty is a big plus it s not the fastest thing on the market it s desent picture quality is great everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy love the fact that i can program it to have her read mins st before she can fully access it also that i can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week,20
when you can get this thing on sale it s an amazing deal have all of your amazon features right in your face books manga gaming amazon it s easy to hold has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen sure the galaxy tablets have better specs but it s the price and features you get from amazon that make this device amazing,20
once the games are downloaded it was great for long road trips,20
family is having fun with alexa i do like the way it integrates with other devices around the home arlo nest,20
this is a great tablet for my teen she loves it and the price can t be beat,20
we have always been nexus tablet desciples and in fact have bought of them for self and family members this one was for granddaughter to replace nexus that had gotten slow this one works better faster than the nexus it s fast easy to use perfect tablet for a child or teenager and can t beat the price very pleased with purchase,20
this has been a very nice addition it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it,20
this is an upgrade tablet from my first kindle fire that i purchased years ago love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads the great hd visuals and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred accessed by this new device love that this fire has a front and rear camer too my old fire only had a front facing camera granted this is not an ipad but i don t want or need all an ipad does and i definitely don t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool my fire tablet does everything i need or want and it costed under i am one satisfied and pleased customer,20
i bought this for my daughter for christmas i could set her as a user and make it safe for her age i downloaded books and apps with ease i m glad that she is loving her fire,20
got this to replace the samsung tab a that samsung tab lagged a lot but i haven t seemed to have as much problems on the fire tab the only downside is that the battery dies fast,20
through all of my research this was the best value for what i was looking for in an e reader with additional options i was not sure i would use or not turns i do because of the ease of usage,20
set up for kids right out of the box can t beat amazon s warranty either thanks for providing an outstanding product,20
great value from best buy bought at christmas sale,20
gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games he loved it it s simple to use and inexpensive,20
the new design is lighter has a longer battery life and the page displays are crisp and clear the light adapts to the environment you are reading in to keep the image consistent the new kindle voyage is amazing,20
have been using this item and it seems to be working quite well,20
great product i will recommend this to all of my family and friends,20
i love my kindle it is user friendly and there s so much more than i thought,20
she love it she said it easy to use she love it very much,20
we bought three including one for my year old we all love it the only complaint is the volume there is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers it doesn t bother us too much but that s why we give it stars overall a great tablet,20
i love my smart portable speaker it has games weather news podcasts radio stations etc if something is missing i can connect my bluetooth phone and stream whatever other audio application i want,20
it works about of the time when asking it a question,20
this makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition but i m not sure i d want it as an adult there are much better tablets on the market but since it s cheap that s to be expected,20
i have an old kindle touch the last one that still had text to voice which no longer works i decided to upgrade started reading the reviews was enticed by the the kindle voyage and took the plunge the voyage is pretty and sleek with neat features and i enjoyed using it for a few days but my frugal self just couldn t justify the price difference between it and the paperwhite while the ambient light sensor was nice i often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room i made more errors of turning a page than i meant to with the page turn because of where the page turn spots are located plus i m in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet so i kept swiping despite the availability of page turn however the clarity of the screen the quality of the light the form factor the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice nonetheless the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the paperwhite the thing i miss most about the voyage is the quality of the light and how even the lighting is on it the unit i had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the voyage i purchased the newest model of the paperwhite and i like it but the lighting appears pretty dingy however it s only when they re compared side to side that i wished i wasn t so cost conscious if money is not an object i d say get the kindle voyage if it is the paperwhite is a fine little reader and overall i m happy i have it,20
i got this tablet for my mother and cousins it s been very speedy to my surprise not as fast as a high end tablet but no lag and a very nice p display with good build quality would definitely recommend if your looking for an affordable tablet,20
the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale,20
killer tablet for the price no issues running any apps or programs,20
i bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices my mother bought him a subscription to the abc mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on at first i was skeptical about spending the extra for the kids fire as i thought it was mainly for the case which i thought to be cheap silicon when the tablet arrived in the mail i was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick heavy duty type of foam it provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops it booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child s account the child s account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don t want them to get a hold of you can set time limits on their account to your desire you can allow and disallow any application you want to their account it comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited which i interpreted as basically prime for kids this allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want the kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate he is able to one click to any apps books games he wants to use it also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top overall i m very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the internet holds if you re not careful,20
my son is constantly distracted and loves technology him being only two years old this proved to be the perfect thing to keep him occupied and out of trouble,20
tablet is very easy to use and navigate the internet,20
i have of these in my house work great i just bought for christmas gifts for my family,20
the alexa show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that i had in the older device i m not sure if i m missing it in the show but i was able to get internet cameras on the older device such as san diego zoo elephants that you can t get on the show while certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch setup was pretty straight forward and easy it is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent it is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want such as play or start or open i use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then more or other combination you would have to set up several different alarms one for each day as far as i can see some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming i don t really want to be terrified awake each day i found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well it would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you d like i don t see that yet anywhere another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off if you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times i d rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe which is possible but very sensitive and if you miss here comes snooze just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly i am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so i can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time hoping that works well when it arrives it will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed all in all i d say it s a good emerging technology but needs a little work considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago it s kind of where we re heading,20
no problem other than setup took a few minutes to finish,20
it is good to have this as a backup lags performance eventually not worth for the money,20
i bought this as a gift for my daughter s nd birthday and she totally loved it now she s wanting me to buy a second one so that i can keep it on the first floor she says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other i think it was a great purchase so i think i m going to have to buy another one,20
this tablet is not only a great price but exactly what i needed for quick internet access and to download books,20
speaker is pretty loud and i love that i can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the home button to use alexa,20
my daughter absolutely love her tablet and i love it to for her it s very kids friendly,20
i m normally an apple snob but needed a cheap tablet and was very surprised how functional the amazon fire is,20
i purchased this kindle for my wife because her kindle fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the fire since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus the main drawback is that the graphics aren t as clear with this reader all in all it was money well spent,20
i bought this for my month old daughter and she has already learned how to use it what a great way to keep her busy and quiet at the same time thanks,20
purchased for my son who loves to read books saw him watching old tv show he sat down with me and showed me what all it could do who would figure i thought it was just for reading books now i want one too,20
whats to say it s kindlelishous,20
this product is easy to use and take along with you,20
i have of these in my house work great i just bought for christmas gifts for my family,20
our daughter loves her new tablet it has a bigger screen more features and she just enjoys being on it the kindle is priced right and is easy to use she was able to get her apps transferred to her new tablet in no time great investment,20
if amazon and google can work things out the show will be amazing we already loved the echo and the dot and were looking forward to adding video unfortunately youtube is no longer on the show limiting the video content if they can ever get it back the show will definitely be a star product,20
this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s in but this is about cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s was not doing it for me,20
kid friendly great appschild can learn many things with this tablet,20
i never used kindle before my wife gifted me on my birthday this is the amazing product i am using it for daily reading the display is fantastic and no strain on eyes,20
i love being able to use alexa she is an amazing ai until the robots rebel against the human kind i think it s worth it,20
it has great speakers and is very easy to set up love my echo,20
very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don t work very well charging port very low quality,20
i love it it does so much and is so easy to use i use it mostly for music and questions,20
i had an alexa but thought the show would be cool as it would allow me to link a camera to it see videos for info i wanted to look up play my prime video account it would have been a if i could see all prime shows movies on it,20
it great just a little small then what i would like it have been,20
the best tablet for kids the year unlimited apps is my favorite my kids love it,20
bought for my husband for christmas we keep it in our kitchen and mainly just use it for music but our kids love that they can tell alexa to play a song they like and it plays,20
i have an original gen echo that has been relocated to my bedroom by simply unplugging and plugging back in now that i have the gen echo plus in my living room and set up to work seamlessly with my gen i could not be happier along with the built in hue it makes it that much better everything works just like i want and the sound on both devices are perfect for me,20
this was a gift that i gave to my daughter at our family christmas party she loves it especially the ease of set up and the attached hub so she can control her lights her nest thermostat this has also gone over well with the grand children,20
love alexa it works so well speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does,20
love how user friendly the kindle fire is for any age,20
very satisfied with this purchase my grandson loved it,20
i lie the size and weight for the kindle makes it very convenient to take large books with me in digital format,20
this kindle fire is lighter than my old one the speed is great all apps load very quickly i also like that it comes in different colors,20
kid friendly great appschild can learn many things with this tablet,20
great product for when you are on the go great sound,20
loved the fire hd but the latest hd is sharper faster and still handles great,20
i was resistant to putting down my real books and begin using a kindle i m so glad i did it s so convenient to shop and instantly download a book plus no more storing hundreds on books in my house,20
i have had a kindle for some time and was curious about the oasis it did not disappoint it is very compact even with the cover and fits in a coat pocket i really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons great device for home or on the go,20
great item would definitely recommend this item am still learning all the things about it,20
i bought this second kindle for the larger storage space and love all the extra stuff i can do now,20
has been very durable with kids and easy to use great product for price,20
got it to gift to my friend absolutely loved it good value,20
bought for my grandson he loves playing with it and enjoys the videos,20
i have an lg tablet but picked up this one for my dad and after messing with it for a while it s very nice i think i like it more the my lg g pad,20
it has very limited use without adding on expensive apps or adding more wireless speakers i am considering returning the merchandise,20
i ve enjoyed using my fire hd tablet to play games,20
i thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm i think it is too small to read on it not very comfortable as regular kindle would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead,20
set up for kids right out of the box can t beat amazon s warranty either thanks for providing an outstanding product,20
added screen a great features visual effect a plus,20
makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that i can see a whole page at one time the protective cover that best buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the on off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that i had to find another cover from another source,20
this tablet is on the smaller side but works for me,20
this was an upgrade from my amazon inch bigger screen was the key for me it s great for listening to music reading books watching movies tv sports tv shows and playing all the games hours of relaxation and entertainment along with amazon s new alexa,20
i have had a kindle for some time and was curious about the oasis it did not disappoint it is very compact even with the cover and fits in a coat pocket i really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons great device for home or on the go,20
great product and service will refer to a friend and the sales man r good,20
my family love alexa and so happy not having to buy any cd or another radio again,20
i m loving this new fire mainly because i didn t fork out a couple hundred for it my only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an ipad so don t look great on this,20
i love the echo alexa is awesome it was a christmas present also received two dots to place in other rooms,20
i purchased two of these tablets as a gift for christmas it has an exceptional hd screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book articles etc,20
great looking display text is sharp and easy to read the lighting of screen is wonderful for reading in lower light environments this is a little more compact than the paper white model i really love the page press button areas makes it so you can turn pages without adjusting your hand as long as you are holding the voyage with your thumb resting in the button area sounds like a minor thing but to me it s a big convenience,20
if amazon and google can work things out the show will be amazing we already loved the echo and the dot and were looking forward to adding video unfortunately youtube is no longer on the show limiting the video content if they can ever get it back the show will definitely be a star product,20
very impressed set up a little confusing but overall a good experience still learning however best buy emails give away any gift secrets had to reset my account to a work email address,20
i bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints,20
great value from best buy bought at christmas sale,20
i bought it for my son in laws birthday after they bought me one for christmas not just good for music but helpful for grandkids homework and now we can video chat with grandkids which the one year old loves,20
this is a great tablet because of all the preloaded games and ability to add more for free it keeps my kids entertained and is the best for learning,20
bought of these for my and yr old and it said it came with gb storage but actual storage was a little less cant remember exactly how much probably around gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre installed they mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them there is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera love the product comes in different color as well i got the blue,20
we love this so much in our home we bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it they love watching their movies on it and playing different apps it is a really good value,20
i have had kindles over the years got to have one to read my books relax,20
these things are cool with the new muti room music options i can have the same song playing in each room not to mention the intercom great item,20
purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year amazon membership the recipient loves it and says it performs very well as a past amazon fire user now i pad graduate i loved my amazon fire for more than years without any problems in fact i just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ,20
great tablet for web access and works well gaming no reason to spend more unless you need a larger screen,20
very handy to get the morning news as well as asking him to play music,20
best electronic i purchased for myself this year great price too,20
it works nice still seems like ancient techonology compared to any apple product,20
i was reluctant to purchase the echo plus and my best friend said to do it you will love it i did and she was so right the philips hue light bulb was an added bonus and love that too,20
i love the the ability to video chat and watch videos on how to do stuff,20
so i bought my little guys these tablets so that i could repossess my ipad love the free time app but who could ve imagined they wouldn t play netflix so now i m out the money for the tablet and still don t have my ipad back and yes i called amazon numerous times they work after the fix but the next time they go to use them they don t work again the fix takes several minutes as it s force stopping the app clearing cache then doing a hard restart then you have to wait to restart netflix oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works if it works at all,20
my wife purchased this for my daughter great for learning to read,20
i brought my tube amplifier to best buy and my magnolia rep hooked it up to a pair of b w series speakers wow it sounded like etta james was right in the room fantastic,20
we use it to talk to our granddaughter play games listen to music and check on the dog while we are at work awesome device we already bought one for our kids also,20
good small tablet for all purposes for reading playing games,20
this is my second one and must have one of these at all times,20
i bought this game for my son and he loves it it is very entertaining,20
i bought two of these one for my son and the other for nephew they love it i downloaded kidsmode on it and all their educational games they can play besides regular games,20
we have always been nexus tablet desciples and in fact have bought of them for self and family members this one was for granddaughter to replace nexus that had gotten slow this one works better faster than the nexus it s fast easy to use perfect tablet for a child or teenager and can t beat the price very pleased with purchase,20
so i was skeptical of echo show and the entire line to be honest however this technology has changed how our household operates from my daily briefing in the morning to tracking santa with my year old every morning learning interesting facts about santa and several other things i truly wish i would have bought this sooner we have it integrated into our cozi account so we can just ask alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in we also have adt pulse and a nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple i couldn t believe it my son loves to ask alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is i am loving the amazon music now as well because we bought an echo dot just to integrate into our bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now if you are on the fence about getting the echo show like i was just do it it really is an amazing product,20
i bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son it s fast and easy to use,20
my nd fire great picture quality easy to use would recommend for all ages,20

i was pleasantly surprised to see the kindle for sale in the store i love my kindle especially since i was able to expand the memory i love that it s portable to be honest when given the choice i find my self on my kindle over my laptop the only thing i can complain about is why in the world amazon choose s to make it nearly a miracle to find a case for its most popular model if you don t have a kindle you don t know what your missing,20
i purchased this kindle fire hd was purchased for use by and yer old grandchildren they basically use it to play amazon games that you download,20
fantastic product and does exactly as described great gift idea,20
this is my th kindle and is easily the best one i ve ever had it is very comfortable to hold and is very compact i was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles it may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery,20
with a seamless integration and easy functionality the echo show is wonderful piece of tech that is entertaining and useful to the whole family,20
i didn t think i would like the echo show especially at the price point but i tried it and love it if i could afford it and if they would add an audio port i would replace my current alexas with echo shows,20
kid friendly great appschild can learn many things with this tablet,20
works very well cheaper than an ipad and works great for apps and video,20
the color is what got me and the features was on point the screen shows a lot of different displays to share for now until the next one,20

i read a huge number of books in kindle format this kindle fire is perfect for that it s just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying it also is great for audible users you will want to install a micro sd card though you can also use it to watch netflix and the like although i don t as a tablet it leaves a lot to be desired if you are looking for a tablet give this a pass it has a lot of system lag and wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal also you should know that you can t access any apps on the google play store it s locked into amazon none of that bothers me because like i said i only use it to read listen to kindle books and this device works perfectly for that bottom line if you just want a kindle reading platform with some extra functionality this will work well for you if you re looking for the full android tablet experience look elsewhere,20
i bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints,20

it was all that my grandson wanted and didn t have to search everywhere to find it,20
i have enjoyed learning about home automation using echo plus and consumers need to know that this comes with having to buy additional equipment to get the most out of alexa,20
i don t know why i waited so long to bring alexa into my home it s how i listen to my music now dictate my shopping and to do lists and get my morning weather report just to name a few i highly recommend this item,20

my grandson really enjoys his new kindle that he for for a christmas present,20
i had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things the extra ram makes a difference very happy and if you re a prime member there are lots of freebies,20

great smart speaker for my year old mother in law,20

it was all that my grandson wanted and didn t have to search everywhere to find it,20
it was by far the best deal out there for the money very happy,20
no instructions on adding the memory card and how to move things to the card vs on internally,20
i picked this up after purchasing an echo i wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my echo i use both devices mostly for music it s great to be able to hear pandora or my amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone laptop etc i can just grab the tap and go anywhere in my house outside to the deck anywhere that i my wireless will reach,20
i am totally addicted easy to use love the call feature,20
gets use everyday by my girlfriend who i bought it for with no complaints also love the color also may get one for myself,20
it is a solid product great for kids i like it a lot,20
with a price tag of this is one of the low end tablets with a lot of features but is certainly worth its price tag but it definitely lacks the features and hd display of its high end variant fire hd,20
this is my eighth kindle some others were either lost or screen damaged i bought it as a spare current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen great price also wish i d bought two,20
my wife loves to read but she was always hesitant to try ebooks she used to think that ebooks could never have the same tactile feel as a physical book i talked her into it by telling her its lighter easier to hold can hold thousands of books and if she hated it we can return it but she loves ebooks now and doesnt want to go back she also found out that amazon has a lot of books which cost nothing namely classics and such i think if you like to read in the dark then get the paperwhite version the led s are a nice touch,20
purchased this for my mother for her birthday she loves it the large screen is what she wanted most,20
bestbuy delivered this on the day of release amazon still seems to be back ordered it is a great product nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance,20

i ve had other kindles and when my current ones storage became low i knew i wanted to purchase another one it can be used for a variety of uses,20
not too satisfied with the sound and it loses bluetooth connection no matter what phone i use either iphone or android,20
easy to use love the color and my daughter loves it easy to set up very happy with my purchase,20
bought this for my year old he loves it and it s very simple to add the perfect parental controls,20
this is great for kids it grows up with them all the apps are good my kid loves it,20

convenient easy to use and grand kids all have one too,20
i love it i can call and do video camaras hear music,20
a great value for the money you can save instead of a ipad from apple,20
i love my new amazon fire tablet it s great the perfect size to fit in my purse so that i can take it with me i would definitely recommend to a friend,20
i love my kindle it is user friendly and there s so much more than i thought,20
purchased for my husband but this is more a gift for the entire family luv the display,20
little putsy so far but there are continuous updates that i think will make this a great device to stay connected with family bought a second for my dad who knows he might replace his land line someday if this gets better i do think our original echo is a bit better at responding but i enjoy this one in the kitchen aka hub of the house,20
i love the cameras and the video capabilities i have set up the picture albums and can even share on facebook and messenger i like the side charger much better than front i love the size too,20
best kindle charger ever took minutes to being my kindle back to life,20
love the choice of colors have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift,20
this is not like other android tablets in a bad way,20
my kid loves this it was one of his favorite christmas presents,20
i have enjoyed using the fire hd it is fast and easy to use i also appreciate all the things it will do,20
i have an old kindle touch the last one that still had text to voice which no longer works i decided to upgrade started reading the reviews was enticed by the the kindle voyage and took the plunge the voyage is pretty and sleek with neat features and i enjoyed using it for a few days but my frugal self just couldn t justify the price difference between it and the paperwhite while the ambient light sensor was nice i often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room i made more errors of turning a page than i meant to with the page turn because of where the page turn spots are located plus i m in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet so i kept swiping despite the availability of page turn however the clarity of the screen the quality of the light the form factor the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice nonetheless the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the paperwhite the thing i miss most about the voyage is the quality of the light and how even the lighting is on it the unit i had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the voyage i purchased the newest model of the paperwhite and i like it but the lighting appears pretty dingy however it s only when they re compared side to side that i wished i wasn t so cost conscious if money is not an object i d say get the kindle voyage if it is the paperwhite is a fine little reader and overall i m happy i have it,20
needs to be a stand alone device i should have not required to use a tablet of cell phone to make it work amazon needs to work on the technology on device,20
i use it mainly for reading e books and browsing however i wished there were more apps available also before unlocking the tablet ads are shown in the lockscreen if the tab is locked it stops streaming the ads you can pay to disable the ads permanently i only recommend this for basic use if you want to use it for games or other apps i would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy,20
i have had kindles over the years got to have one to read my books relax,20
the battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge i bought the fire in july and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it i am not impressed and would not repurchase it,20
my and year old download their own games easy to set up and get working thanks to parental control i know what they are downloading,20
this is an awesome product this is the first echo product i owned and i purchased to get off i was going to split with a friend but like this so much that i decided to keep both i ve being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos the videos on youtube takes a more effort to find the ones i want but i think this will improve over time,20
i was jealous when our son showed us his amazon show and some of the things it was capable of doing since aol eliminated instant messaging my wife and i were less able to communicate because our offices are on separate floors so we got two shows and two spots and now not only can intercom easily but use alexa for music and many other things we will probably start using some smart home devices which alexa can also control it s a fun device which seems to be getting better all the time,20
easy to use wide variety of functions awesome price,20
my daughter loves her kindle and it s larger than the previous one she had she enjoys it,20
gift was on point recipient was very pleased would recommend to others,20
this was a christmas present for my niece she loved it,20
the show is a great little product it has opened a lot of doors in the world of ai and home automation for me it connected easily with my echo and dot and now i can stream music all over my house the picture quality is outstanding the only drawback is that alexa doesn t have a very strong internet search engine,20
i love this tablet for kids it s so much fun for them great buy,20
i bought this tablet for it s inexpensive price and quality it s meant to be a portal to be able to purchase more products from amazon and services but it really is a high quality product,20
she loves it the only problem i have is getting it away from her even while riding in vehicles lol,20
i have the echo and a dot this is great for video calling and intercom calling in the house use it every day i run all my photo s stored on amazon prime and for music,20
i have enjoyed learning about home automation using echo plus and consumers need to know that this comes with having to buy additional equipment to get the most out of alexa,20
i bought this for my mom and she loves it she said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting it s easy for her to read,20
i got this for a friends son the only problem with it is he won t put it down lol,20
we the concept to learn and adapt to the ever changing word this product should stand out,20
thank you great product for all ages thank you,20
it great just a little small then what i would like it have been,20
this was a christmas present the person that received it was very happy with it she has other kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones,20
got this tablet for my year old son and he can not put it down it is so much to do so many learning games i love this product,20
i purchased two of these for my kids ages and forget the ipod touch for the price this tablet can t be beat they can download games books and movies for free all included with my amazon prime membership awesome,20
love the color just the right size easy to set up works well for what i needed it for great price,20
i was hesitant and i am now hooked this is both fun and useful,20
using the kindle to read books and stream videos is very easy and enjoyable,20
with this you can make calls to other echo shows or using the app you can call others that have the a show i haven t used this feature yet since i m the only one i know who has one i can tell you that while using the app at home or away from home off the network you can call the show i did this while at work to check it out and caught my son coming in the back door i freaked him out but after he settled down we chatted via video chat for awhile and both agreed it was awesome you could also just drop into the show from the app to check on the house or whatever wherever you have it keep in mind you re only gonna see what it s pointed at the camera doesn t move plus in its natural form it is tilted back slightly so it point upward there are stands on amazon the correct the tilt to make it straight up and down almost forgot but the speakers are amazing you can link multiple echos together to play music i have the show in my living room an echo in my bedroom and the dot connected to a jbl speaker in another room after set up through the app i can tell alexa to play music and they all come to life,20
the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs it works well as promised,20
does exactly what it is needed for my daughter and comes at a great price,20
so i was skeptical of echo show and the entire line to be honest however this technology has changed how our household operates from my daily briefing in the morning to tracking santa with my year old every morning learning interesting facts about santa and several other things i truly wish i would have bought this sooner we have it integrated into our cozi account so we can just ask alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in we also have adt pulse and a nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple i couldn t believe it my son loves to ask alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is i am loving the amazon music now as well because we bought an echo dot just to integrate into our bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now if you are on the fence about getting the echo show like i was just do it it really is an amazing product,20
my daughter loves her kindle and it s larger than the previous one she had she enjoys it,20
i had my doubts when i first purchased it but after just a day i had synced it with my thermostat lights tv bose sound system and many more amazing product couldn t be happier,20
i m not a techie but after days of trying to hook up i gave up i don t know if it was the echo plus or my carrier att uverse causing the issue but it would not connect so back to the store it went even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistance none of it worked,20
makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that i can see a whole page at one time the protective cover that best buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the on off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that i had to find another cover from another source,20
nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better,20
the kindle is great for just reading books and the battery power is pretty good the experimental browser is not very user friendly,20
got it as a gift for my dad so far so good didn t not realise the special offers are ads spend more money to buy the one with out them also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection you now need wifi to connect to the store,20
just installed but like it so far the picture is clear and the price is affordable,20
i bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son it s fast and easy to use,20
great for my son i monitor school work and apps he downloads,20
i found the amazon fire hd to be very easy to travel back and forth to school i can easily transfer my work in class to my main computer at home,20
great inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps,20
i didn t know what i was missing out on until i got an echo plus,20
my kid love this tablet the setup was so easy and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps that my kid can enjoy playing and learning,20
great tablet perfect for my year old son,20
easy to use wide variety of functions awesome price,20
i purchase this tablet for my daughter s birthday and she absolutely loves it i am very pleased that she s not able to get online or to get on youtube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can t get into it i would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the google play store since it is an amazon tablet,20
i can t update facebook and a few other apps it s not what i expected,20
needs to be a stand alone device i should have not required to use a tablet of cell phone to make it work amazon needs to work on the technology on device,20
love the color just the right size easy to set up works well for what i needed it for great price,20
i tryed the gb to see if it was any different from the gb and found little difference may hold more apps,20
works great for everything we want our daughter to do,20
amazon echo show is the best of all my amazon products i love the hands free but able to see things on the screen,20
was gift fot my daughter she seems to enjoy very much,20
your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps videos and the internet you can not get a better deal the yr anything happens warranty is a big plus it s not the fastest thing on the market it s desent picture quality is great everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy love the fact that i can program it to have her read mins st before she can fully access it also that i can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week,20
purchased for my son who loves to read books saw him watching old tv show he sat down with me and showed me what all it could do who would figure i thought it was just for reading books now i want one too,20
bought this mostly as a backup and to read a few books since i have a larger cell phone and a back up used it occasionally may or hours of use till this week when i sent my laptop in for repairs so i probably used it a tot this week i was watching my rd primetime video this week and it simply turned off it will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode it is gone it is toast bought it october it quit on february my old fire lasted or years with more use it had stereo speakers lasted a week on a charge not or days sturdier built this is full of junk i am not just offered more apps it is constantly trying to add them junk junk junk,20
bought this for my year old he loves it and it s very simple to add the perfect parental controls,20
i bought this for my wife and absolutely loves it alexa is so smart and helps my wife with everything like a personal assistant,20
i bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit i set it up with her as the user entered her age and name and now amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age simple to do and she loves the capabilities i also bought and installed a gig sd card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage for the price i think this tablet is best one out there you can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost,20
we returned it could not give answers to our questions even though the answers were easily found on google,20
granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday,20
i didn t think i would like the echo show especially at the price point but i tried it and love it if i could afford it and if they would add an audio port i would replace my current alexas with echo shows,20
i can t update facebook and a few other apps it s not what i expected,20
got it to gift to my friend absolutely loved it good value,20
my son loves his new tablet now he can play his games without making a mess of my phone,20
i love amazon products easy to use and install i recommend them very good sound and above all price,20
exactly what i was looking for size wise and functional,20
we already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter they are a good learning tool,20
already have the echo and dot has good sound quality and with the hub feature you can control the hue lights with alexa which is convenient when walking in the house with a bunch of groceries,20
meh it works i find it difficult to navigate i also have an ipad mini this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad,20
i was hesitant and i am now hooked this is both fun and useful,20
the ultimate bluetooth speaker i have multiple amazon echos and a whole echo system set up in my house i love everything amazon i can t stand apple but now i know how they feel i am a cult member of amazon lol so anyway i have been trashing this device the tap because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things i like most about the echo the only flaw of the echo is it is not portable i tried the triby but i did not like it more for little kids so on black friday the amazon tap was on super sale so i bought it the tap is smaller than i thought it was about rd the size of the echo which is perfect for portability but don t let the size fool you the sound is only short of bose when it comes to volume and sound quality important note you don t have to have an echo to use this device just the alexa app on your smart phone the tap does everything the echo does it is an amazing bluetooth speaker and it s portable automatically switches remembers different wifi areas and can be used with a hot spot the most amazing thing about the whole amazon echo system is that amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does some things even better than google now and light years ahead of siri the tap is my new favorite device it is perfect the only flaw is that it is not waterproof amazon if you are listening make the next tap waterproof,20
i love hear readers i had to replace mine because i destroyed the last but it is awesome,20
i ve had kindles for years and this latest one is also right up at the top,20
i had some thoughts about getting this for a year old but if you get the screen protector and a case i feel it will last a long time,20
i got the first version for my sister and she hasn t been able to put it down on over a year then i got her this one and forget about it great new features she loves loves loves it,20
this is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading,20
i really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well,20
a great new amazon device to add to my other alexa products the visuals are amazing and it is so easy to use and set up,20
easy to use and great selection of books movies and games,20
best kindle charger ever took minutes to being my kindle back to life,20
i think the price is great the durability the easiness although you do need to spend money as well for extra better games and the charger breaks easily but u can use any android charger overall well worth the price i believe,20
just installed but like it so far the picture is clear and the price is affordable,20
good tablet but no youtube kids like on iphone don t expect iphone pad quality very basic appstore for children,20
bought this to carry around for internet and gaming so far very happy,20
i tryed the gb to see if it was any different from the gb and found little difference may hold more apps,20
i had an alexa but thought the show would be cool as it would allow me to link a camera to it see videos for info i wanted to look up play my prime video account it would have been a if i could see all prime shows movies on it,20
this is great product the tablet are made tough and great price,20
does exactly what it is needed for my daughter and comes at a great price,20
my fire is compact and easy to use mainly used to read online books at lunch time the battery lasts much longer than previous tablet i had and charges much quicker very happy with my fire,20
the only thing i have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device why is that,20
i love my original kindle fire but the size and features on the latest kindle are a plus,20
replacement tablet for my wife no complaints she watches netflix on it a lot,20
fun to use for any age just say alexa,20
i love it the sound is great i use it everyday for my dogs to listen to when i am at work,20
i am using it for my year old and she loves it,20
bought it for my wife and i haven t heard any complaints so i think it s great if she s happy i m happy,20
bought it on sale for christmas gift and we ll worth the money does everything needed with good functionality easy to use for those not too tech savvy,20
slower than my last kindle the power button is not easy accesible when in a case,20
we already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter they are a good learning tool,20
this is my third kindle second fire i use it constantly primarily for reading electronic books currently have over books in kindle library like it best when traveling as i don t have to carry a bunch of hardback books with me anywhere i go where i know there will be a waiting line haircut doctor s or dentist s office i have it with me and use it productively to read,20
the tablet with an added protective case has so far held up better than other tablets i have tried and the parental controls are great i can also add educational apps that i want,20
it works well and sounds decent but the hub portion of this is not as easy to use as samsung,20
it s a nice upgrade from the screen size is just right for small kids hands reading kindle books is much easier,20
great tablet not for the power user average users will find everything they need,20
i bought this for my grandson and it hasn t disappointed me at all he loves his tablet i am looking at buying his sister one next,20
i like being able to ask about the weather set an alarm on my phone or create a shopping list all by just asking elexia,20
tablet works will with amazon video on our smart tvs as well as the firesticks,20
convenient easy to use and grand kids all have one too,20
very nice people and good product i would buy from again,20
i ve had kindles for years and this latest one is also right up at the top,20
i never used kindle before my wife gifted me on my birthday this is the amazing product i am using it for daily reading the display is fantastic and no strain on eyes,20
my sister in law recommended these to my wife and i and i thought i would try one they are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while,20
great tablet for price display is clear enjoy books on tablet,20
this is my eighth kindle some others were either lost or screen damaged i bought it as a spare current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen great price also wish i d bought two,20
great product but the only downside is that it did not work with my home security camera,20
small enough to carry every where when he is using it you can hear a pin drop,20
this is a good tablet for my son to use to play his games,20
so my month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet however my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my ipad but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys which makes the kindle fire tablet for kids the best invention since the tivo all the pre loaded apps videos books etc is nothing short of amazing the case is also very cool hardwood floor and stair case proof for under bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine,20
bought this for my better half and she loves it it works very well with echo and has unlimited features,20
added screen a great features visual effect a plus,20
was a gift and they love the tablet its a great price and works awesome,20
this is my second one and must have one of these at all times,20
this is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device,20
i purchased this product because i love to read and buying books got costly with this product i can read all i want for a month,20
i use this thing every night to fall asleep although alexa don t always understand me i still love the device,20
i bought the white version and have it in the kitchen i use it for everything music video phone security cams news weather it s the perfect kitchen assistant,20
i absolutely love my kindle i go nowhere without it it has kept me entertained for hours don t have to keep up with books that get torn or lost i would and do recommend a kindle for everyone,20
the kindle is amazing this is my second one the price was misleading however as i had to pay something like another extra bucks to get rid of the ads just know that,20
i have of these in my house work great i just bought for christmas gifts for my family,20
i had an alexa but thought the show would be cool as it would allow me to link a camera to it see videos for info i wanted to look up play my prime video account it would have been a if i could see all prime shows movies on it,20
with a seamless integration and easy functionality the echo show is wonderful piece of tech that is entertaining and useful to the whole family,20
bought for my wife to upgrade from the original kindle that she has worn out big step up from the original and should be good for another years,20
this is a great product i also have a dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus the hands free mode works just like the dot and the sound is great i use the tap all the time working on projects making shopping lists playing games to turning on the lights i looked at the echo but even with a battery pack it didn t seem very mobile,20
wanted to expand alexa into multiple rooms of the house this device added easily into the system and can now listen to music in multiple rooms,20
this tablet does a great deal from surfing the net to watching movie and using all of the music channels this is an affordable way to stay in touch also i use it for ebooks for school,20
this is my eighth kindle some others were either lost or screen damaged i bought it as a spare current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen great price also wish i d bought two,20
this is my third one of these and this is the best one by far,20
through all of my research this was the best value for what i was looking for in an e reader with additional options i was not sure i would use or not turns i do because of the ease of usage,20
i bought this tablet for my two yr old granddaughter for christmas and she loves the games and camera works great glad i got it for her,20
great tablet for the price we have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids this is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids,20
very satisfied with this purchase my grandson loved it,20
just what i was looking for to putin my guest room it has a good picture,20
looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened,20
i haven t used this yet it is a gift for my father but i think he ll love it,20
this does the same stuff as the traditional echo or echo dot except it has a screen if you already liked the echo s this is a good addition the addition of the screen is neat but certainly not essential you can see daily news headlines and the weather scroll across the screen you can watch any arlo or similar cameras on it you can watch youtube and amazon video as well but you ll probably just watch that on a phone tablet or tv instead,20
our daughter loves her new tablet it has a bigger screen more features and she just enjoys being on it the kindle is priced right and is easy to use she was able to get her apps transferred to her new tablet in no time great investment,20
purchased this for my fiance s youngest son for christmas and also to replace his broken no name handheld he loved it the speed ease of use and size were perfect for him he mostly uses it for music youtube and instagram all of which seem to work fine on it it was also very affordable he s happy with it so we are too,20
the only thing i would say is that you have to do a work around for direct tv other that that it is great,20
it can stream music really well and not just from amazon i was expecting it to be smart like watson but it is more like an blank stare amazon should look into predicting questions like during superbowl play offs alexa was unable to display or update the play off brackets it understands my voice really well were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what i am saying it want pair to my portable bluetooth speaker it will pair to my cell phone but only to receive music from it the audio quality is varies with amplitude with low amplitudes alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room but an amplitude setting of about the audio becomes clear and understandable i really like playing games like jeopardy with alexa no climbing through the closet to find a box anymore and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing,20
i bought this for learning and entertaining purposes my daughter is enjoys it i compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price protection plan this works best for us,20
my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her kindle,20
i love to use alexa to listen to music set timer alarms and ect my parents use the show to show the cameras and stuff for a second control panel to their security system,20
great tablet and price ordering online easy not happy took so long to receive though,20
purchased due to reviews and in sale so far easy to use,20
runs great very efficient for what we use it for,20
this tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality,20
we replaced and aging fire hdx she noticed the wifi connection is improved and the screen is larger she prefers this to my ipad air,20
this is not like other android tablets in a bad way,20
great notepad huge screen and easily downloaded apps to use love it,20
tablet is very easy to use and navigate the internet,20
she is alexa better younger sister love her and some of the new skills great,20
love playing music and talking to alexa and looking at my camera three the screen,20
i was pleasantly surprised to see the kindle for sale in the store i love my kindle especially since i was able to expand the memory i love that it s portable to be honest when given the choice i find my self on my kindle over my laptop the only thing i can complain about is why in the world amazon choose s to make it nearly a miracle to find a case for its most popular model if you don t have a kindle you don t know what your missing,20
i bought both of my children one of these tablets they love it,20
i have an original gen echo that has been relocated to my bedroom by simply unplugging and plugging back in now that i have the gen echo plus in my living room and set up to work seamlessly with my gen i could not be happier along with the built in hue it makes it that much better everything works just like i want and the sound on both devices are perfect for me,20
best item i ever use i would love to get another one,20
my yr old grand daughter loves her new tablet now she can watch mickey clubhouse whenever she wants,20
it great just a little small then what i would like it have been,20
my son really enjoys this its his first tablet he is and had no problem learning how to use it,20
it did exactly what it s suppose to and i m still learning new features a month after having it very good decice,20
i bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips,20
got this tablet for my year old son and he can not put it down it is so much to do so many learning games i love this product,20
i love my new amazon fire tablet it s great the perfect size to fit in my purse so that i can take it with me i would definitely recommend to a friend,20
originally i bought this for my and year olds they loved it and so did i so many things to do on them and so much of what they love i now got it as well for my year old the best part of it all is the cases come with the tablets and they have colors to choose from so perfect for me,20
the echo show is a great addition to the amazon family works just like the echo but with a screen bright vibrant display rich clear sound works great with arlo security cameras excellent smart home addition just hope google and amazon start playing nice with each other soon so youtube will work again,20
nice upgrade from my old kindle i like it very much,20
it can stream music really well and not just from amazon i was expecting it to be smart like watson but it is more like an blank stare amazon should look into predicting questions like during superbowl play offs alexa was unable to display or update the play off brackets it understands my voice really well were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what i am saying it want pair to my portable bluetooth speaker it will pair to my cell phone but only to receive music from it the audio quality is varies with amplitude with low amplitudes alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room but an amplitude setting of about the audio becomes clear and understandable i really like playing games like jeopardy with alexa no climbing through the closet to find a box anymore and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing,20
when it works it s great but for some reason it doesn t always answer me when it doesn t answer me i turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn t work at that time it was easy to set up with the phone app doesn t seem to matter where the phone is when it isn t working i ve tried close and far and in between so a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn t,20
it s alright to browse the internet and watch videos,20
this is a great tablet for my teen she loves it and the price can t be beat,20
the kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu,20
i bought this for my wife this is her third amazon fire tablet she mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one she s very happy with it,20
this is a great tablet for kids as it is not too expensive and there is a year warranty if it breaks within years they replace it my year is very rough with things my husband was letting him plug the charger in by himself and jammed it into the tablet causing the charging port to break i had no problems getting it replaced,20
amazon kindle is always the best ebook upgrade every new model,20
love the choice of colors have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift,20
like the fact that i can see videos and utilize ir with my lighting system,20
i bought this tablet to replace one i had different brand that was worn out this is a pretty good tablet for the price i just wanted something to use til i could get something bigger i ve had no problems with it other than some of the games i played on my other one not being available on the fire,20
i haven t used this yet it is a gift for my father but i think he ll love it,20
my granddaughter loves her pink tablet she is four and able to use on her own,20
biting as a gift my only concern was the size and the amazon interface it was easy enough to download the google play store so it was familiar to the user size was an initial concern but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome,20
bought it for my wife and i haven t heard any complaints so i think it s great if she s happy i m happy,20
video integration it s big plus for video calling kids at home and quick check who s at the door when doorbell rings,20
i gave my paperwhite to a friend and bought the voyage i like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages i don t know that it s really worth all of the extra cost compared to the paperwhite especially since the new one just came out with dpi,20
i love my echo show elexa is so helpfull she answers just about every question i have,20
i am loving my amazon echo show it makes life easier i love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking alexa i also love being able to video call friends and family that have an echo show or the alexa app overall it is a great product,20
i bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son it s fast and easy to use,20
this works well as it was a gift and connected without issue along with the other two,20
better than nook also cheaper if toy areally looking to use as a tablet not the best choice great for reading and basic searching,20
so many things you can use it for love working my lights,20
this is a nice little tablet for me since i don t do a lot on a tablet it s a great size it took a little getting use to working with but am a little more comfortable with it now,20
i have never owned a tablet wanted an i pad like most but couldn t afford the sticker price this one fit my needs perfect i mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video no complaints so far i would recommend this device,20
we have sonos speakers and a honeywell lyric thermostat it took a little searching on google to get things linked now that they are linked we can play music in any room and change our home temperature by using alexa,20
we use it to talk to our granddaughter play games listen to music and check on the dog while we are at work awesome device we already bought one for our kids also,20
absolutely love kindle kids edition easy to use great apps and love it comes with year warranty must have for my kids,20
awesome product and cool design and a great color i would recommend to a friend,20
got it to gift to my friend absolutely loved it good value,20

i wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick i ll get flowers next time,20
we replaced and aging fire hdx she noticed the wifi connection is improved and the screen is larger she prefers this to my ipad air,20
i use it for everything mainly as my new alarm clock cant wait for them to open it up even more,20
gift was on point recipient was very pleased would recommend to others,20
when used with amazon prime and the freetime app for kids this is a great tablet recommend installing at least gb of micro sd card storage and install apps to the card to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos easy enough to use for our year old grandson,20
the echo plus is a fantastically easy to use smarthome hub it is easy to setup fast and responsive has a ton of capabilities that are expanding daily and looks and sounds great i currently use mine to manage my smart things like light bulbs lamps smart switches and even my robot vac it has made automating a lot of what i do daily a breeze and has simplified my life where i didn t know it needed to be simplified definitely worth the extra money to go with the plus over the echo or the dot,20
i purchased two of these tablets as a gift for christmas it has an exceptional hd screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book articles etc,20
having an assistant like echo makes life so much easier,20
i bought this as a backup i am currently using the same headphone,20
i can t update facebook and a few other apps it s not what i expected,20
i bought this as a backup i am currently using the same headphone,20
the graphics and sound on this tablet were better than expected,20
i would recommend this product it works great and ver compact,20
purchased after theft in seattle it was on sale and works great,20
i have enjoyed learning about home automation using echo plus and consumers need to know that this comes with having to buy additional equipment to get the most out of alexa,20
love the color just the right size easy to set up works well for what i needed it for great price,20
i can t update facebook and a few other apps it s not what i expected,20

this tablet does a great deal from surfing the net to watching movie and using all of the music channels this is an affordable way to stay in touch also i use it for ebooks for school,20
great item to upgrade your house works very well,20
needs to be a stand alone device i should have not required to use a tablet of cell phone to make it work amazon needs to work on the technology on device,20
this thing works great i would recommend to all of my friends should have bought one sooner we listen to music non stop now,20
it was all that my grandson wanted and didn t have to search everywhere to find it,20
it does everything amazon and i can even see who is at the front door with arlo it doesn t do netflix or hulu but that s okay i really like the sound it fills small rooms it s easy now to video chat with nana or drop in to tell my kid s goodnight when i am working late,20
this is my first tablet love it actually read my first e book on it large screen easy to read play games fits nicely in my purse,20
we re still learning all the things this device can do so far we re very pleased,20
it was all that my grandson wanted and didn t have to search everywhere to find it,20
great overall would be nice to have parental controls though,20
so my old kindle stopped working recently not sure why but it would not connect to our new router so i checked with best buy and saw they had kindle on sale for which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet i especially like that i can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light so far i have read books in the past months on this kindle and it flawless,20

this is my third kindle and the best one yet love the new controls the backlit page the compact size and the ease of use i would recommend the kindle voyage to all readers,20
i don t recommend buying this after month of buying this it won t charge or turn on,20
alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated,20
it is nice to have access to the features this offers,20
great choice battery life outstanding many kid friendly features,20
what i expected a better then budget tablet ata good price bought for the integration with alexa and it works well more info about your alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet,20
i m not huge on kids using electronics but my son loves this when we take trips as he can play some of the downloaded games we love it for when we want to get stuff done and still want him to be occupied and this does the trick it s a little hard to navigate at first though,20
great tablet for my and year old kid friendly safe and mom and dad enjoy it as well love that it comes in a protective case reasonably priced for a great tablet the kids love,20
replacement tablet for my wife no complaints she watches netflix on it a lot,20
difficult to purchase no stock in stores no order online or ship to store available when it did become available it did not work once it turned on i couldn t get any further i could not log onto wifi network though other items in my household work also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock tried days gave up and returned the item,20
i received an original echo two years ago and use it in my office this year i decided to get one for the house and was amazed at all the features i hadn t taken advantage of primarily the smart home features this was great because it came with a lightbulb,20
great bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of alexa,20
i waited a couple months to review giving amazon time to make this product equal to the sony dash from nearly a decade ago it isn t the screen provides nothing of value and you can t turn of amazon tips you have near zero customization can t even move the clock to the other side of the screen and something that a sony dash did nearly years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm seriously this is the biggest fail run away from this half baked amazon disaster,20
this product is amazing i wasn t quite sure why everyone was going on and on about having one but now that it s in my house i cannot imagine life without it alexa not only answers my questions and gives me valuable information but now she controls the lights of my house for me i highly recommend this,20
i saw this product used by friends and was so impressed i bought one for my husband for christmas,20
overall it is a good tablet but i am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and amazon app store,20
child loves it can be used for more than just a time killer can learn from it,20
has built in smart hub unlike other echos works with other smart home devices with no additional purchases,20
very helpful for someone with disabilities saves a lot steps responsive and fun to use,20
purchased this to get a lighter tablet also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery this is all around lighter thinner and easier to handle hd is a good upgrade and can t beat the price for comparable tablets with same features my wife reads on it daily and loves it i am probably going to search for another one we have the and i would like to try a if it were available i like to try different size devices to see how i adjust same way with todays phones,20
product is good light amazing battery backup i charge the kindle one in weeks great product for reasonable price usb connection is easy books are easy to download overall everyone must have kindle with them and this is the best product model to start with understandably this is the beginner level model for people who never used kindle before features like led lights white paper background are not available on this model these features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in dark without lights but again for this price you would not get any other good readers if you are someone who reads in dark then i would suggest go for higher kindle models,20
they are both responsive to each other and it gives me convenience i don t have to turn off the lights and all i do is lay down and ask alexa to turn off the light all my lights are connected to my echo plus,20
fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the,20
i bought the kindle fire hd as a christmas gift for my mom she has never had a computer or kindle she loves it best gift i gave her she plays a lot of games on it that keeps her mind working love the size of screen,20
christmas gift for my son and my husband can t wait to hook it up,20
it did exactly what it s suppose to and i m still learning new features a month after having it very good decice,20
best xmas gift and great product made by amazon now my fam is all connected,20
i love my kindle it s perfect for reading my favorite books,20
the kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading,20
for a cheap starter tablet it s fine bought it to replace a cheaper kids tablet and it ll do for that,20
great buy after owning the original kindle fire it s very versatile and shows the progress made from the original you can t lose and pair it with amazon prime,20
bought this for a gift for some one who s old tablet won t work just the right size to play games on,20
sound is amazing wish alexa knew more things i get a lot of i m sorry i don t know that which is unfortunate,20
great learning tool for my granddaughter she loves it,20
not sure why but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it very disappointing,20
i bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son it s fast and easy to use,20
my son is constantly distracted and loves technology him being only two years old this proved to be the perfect thing to keep him occupied and out of trouble,20
this is the most amazing item and very easy to use,20
we have bought two taps one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son we love the portability of the tap it s perfect for our deck our grandchildren love it too,20
very satisfied with product as do my family kids,20
it s the perfect tablet for a kid to watch cartoons and play games the protection is awesome,20
i got the first version for my sister and she hasn t been able to put it down on over a year then i got her this one and forget about it great new features she loves loves loves it,20
this is a great tablet for the price i have one that i purchased a few years ago and use it much more than my laptop recently purchased two more for gifts,20
i debated on what tablet reader to buy and decided on the fire i have been very pleased with it bought it on sale what a great price,20
i bought this as a gift for my daughter s nd birthday and she totally loved it now she s wanting me to buy a second one so that i can keep it on the first floor she says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other i think it was a great purchase so i think i m going to have to buy another one,20
i had my doubts when i first purchased it but after just a day i had synced it with my thermostat lights tv bose sound system and many more amazing product couldn t be happier,20
this device is alot better than the small alexa did everything i wanted it to,20
bought a few kindles in the past but this time one of it came defective the port was bent and it was hard to charge but still possible comes in different color was gb enough space for kids has camera ok quality not the best but ok for pics taken by kids,20
was gift fot my daughter she seems to enjoy very much,20
i recently had purchased enough smart home devices to make this a good addition for the home it works well with smart outlets our ring doorbell and fairly well with our nest thermostat my only complaint is that sometimes for no reason it will start plying a movie trailer and it s hard to get it to stop still all in all we re happy with the purchase,20
this is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device,20
this is my third kindle the best differentiator is the form factor definite improvement over the paperwhite also like having the page turn buttons back case is very cool indeed if you can get past the jump in price remember you re not having to buy the case separately it s a quality product to have,20
bought it on sale for christmas gift and we ll worth the money does everything needed with good functionality easy to use for those not too tech savvy,20
set up for kids right out of the box can t beat amazon s warranty either thanks for providing an outstanding product,20
i purchased two of these for my kids ages and forget the ipod touch for the price this tablet can t be beat they can download games books and movies for free all included with my amazon prime membership awesome,20
i bought of these for gifts i love my echo and think the new one will be incredible too after the holidays i will buy one for myself,20
so i bought my little guys these tablets so that i could repossess my ipad love the free time app but who could ve imagined they wouldn t play netflix so now i m out the money for the tablet and still don t have my ipad back and yes i called amazon numerous times they work after the fix but the next time they go to use them they don t work again the fix takes several minutes as it s force stopping the app clearing cache then doing a hard restart then you have to wait to restart netflix oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works if it works at all,20
bought this for my teenage daughter and it works beautifully with great battery life,20
i love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can t get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which i don t because i have a four and year old there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups,20
i absolutely love my kindle i go nowhere without it it has kept me entertained for hours don t have to keep up with books that get torn or lost i would and do recommend a kindle for everyone,20
i m an amazon prime member and the show is awsum i use it to communicate with the son who lives in seattle you can watch amazon pirime tv play amazon music text play games read the lyrics while the song is playing i love it,20
i like this ereader it is a little small but you can increase the font,20
bought this for my better half and she loves it it works very well with echo and has unlimited features,20
this was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books couple this with amazon gift cards and the library is endless,20
i ve had other kindles and when my current ones storage became low i knew i wanted to purchase another one it can be used for a variety of uses,20
this tablet has many educational games for a preschooler,20
works great i bought for the kitchen and for master bath,20
got it to gift to my friend absolutely loved it good value,20
this kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach,20
the amazon fire tablets are nice tablets they re especially great for streaming tv and movies and since it s a kindle it s great for books too it is a little odd with the internet browser and still a little limited in the app store but overall a great little tablet,20
best xmas gift and great product made by amazon now my fam is all connected,20
my only dislike is that being a kindle my kindle books cannot be sorted into categories it s harder to find new books i ve downloaded some time ago when i have to search through all of them,20
what is there to say but that i love it functions well and lasts a long time,20
i love that this tablet came preloaded all we needed to do was charge it and my child had access to many books at an appropriate level,20
liked the first one so much i bought one for the wife,20
i bought several alexa s for christmas gifts also for myself also bought amazon show for christmas gift also for a my youngest daugter,20
i bought the kindle fire hd as a christmas gift for my mom she has never had a computer or kindle she loves it best gift i gave her she plays a lot of games on it that keeps her mind working love the size of screen,20
looks nice can t wait to try it out great price for a tablet,20
i would highly recommend the kindle fire for a first time user it was really very easy to learn to navigate,20
fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything,20
i bought this for my wife and absolutely loves it alexa is so smart and helps my wife with everything like a personal assistant,20
i love this and it s great for kids got it for a early christmas gift for a friends son and he loves it,20
upgraded my year old kindle same old doesnt seem that great of a difference the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading,20
excellent for what you pay and always good shopping at bestbuy,20
bought this for my year old grandson who s a bit rough but loves to play games and read he loves it,20
fun to use for any age just say alexa,20
this was a gift for my kids they love them easy to use and lots of great apps,20
i enjoyed and i bought an echo too to make all my family take the pleasure of it,20
i bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop i thought this looked more user friendly since she knows my year old nephew can use an ipad,20
my son wanted a tablet just for his books we looked at e readers and tablets this was so much better and the price was perfect,20
i purchased a echo for home so added a tap for my office at work so i can chat with alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent bt speaker for my office this has great sound streaming my prime music and xm vis the xm app can t go wrong quality music and alexa when i need some help with spelling hard word s she getting smart pick one up you have a woman to talk to when the wife is out,20
it works well and sounds decent but the hub portion of this is not as easy to use as samsung,20
i love the alexa system of assistance this version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won t get to have to the option to pick up you need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private i installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use,20
this tablet is so great for school children to play and learn on,20
the echo show is a great addition to the amazon family works just like the echo but with a screen bright vibrant display rich clear sound works great with arlo security cameras excellent smart home addition just hope google and amazon start playing nice with each other soon so youtube will work again,20
love it works great one in each of the main rooms,20
i love my smart portable speaker it has games weather news podcasts radio stations etc if something is missing i can connect my bluetooth phone and stream whatever other audio application i want,20
easy access to book reader love watching my netflix con slow getting on internet,20
i love hear readers i had to replace mine because i destroyed the last but it is awesome,20
we replaced and aging fire hdx she noticed the wifi connection is improved and the screen is larger she prefers this to my ipad air,20
i bought this as a backup i am currently using the same headphone,20
i would recommend this to anyone who like to speak commands to technology and have it respond i purchased this for my husband who is sick and he can ask for weather music sport events and more great item,20
i bought this for my grandson and it hasn t disappointed me at all he loves his tablet i am looking at buying his sister one next,20
she loves it the only problem i have is getting it away from her even while riding in vehicles lol,20
bought the echo first and liked it so much i bought a tap to add mobility i carry it around all the time to the garage working out etc,20
so my old kindle stopped working recently not sure why but it would not connect to our new router so i checked with best buy and saw they had kindle on sale for which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet i especially like that i can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light so far i have read books in the past months on this kindle and it flawless,20
setting up the amazon show was a little tricky but i managed to navigate through it it s so cool to add compatible equipment,20
the kids love it they ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer i really like for the music aspect just tell it a song and it finds it,20
my fire is compact and easy to use mainly used to read online books at lunch time the battery lasts much longer than previous tablet i had and charges much quicker very happy with my fire,20
i can t update facebook and a few other apps it s not what i expected,20
great tablet perfect for my year old son,20
great sound love the music and the electrical devices you can work with it,20
purchased this for my wife during christmas and got a great deal on it compared to the older version that she has this model is faster brighter and more convenient with alexa i would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it,20
very impressed set up a little confusing but overall a good experience still learning however best buy emails give away any gift secrets had to reset my account to a work email address,20
my family love alexa and so happy not having to buy any cd or another radio again,20
great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on black friday,20
great speaker and echo substitute this is great for on the go as a bluetooth speaker and when connected to the internet it works great using the alexa app,20
was not hard to set up and love the quality good screen size and clarity,20
this is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading,20
great tablet for streaming good internet connection along with a nice display,20
this is my th kindle and is easily the best one i ve ever had it is very comfortable to hold and is very compact i was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles it may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery,20
pleased with alexa have not used light yet i ll update after use,20
this is a very neat item love all the things this can do,20
i have the echo and a dot this is great for video calling and intercom calling in the house use it every day i run all my photo s stored on amazon prime and for music,20
my wife purchased this for my daughter great for learning to read,20
this was a christmas present for my niece she loved it,20
purchased this for my fiance s youngest son for christmas and also to replace his broken no name handheld he loved it the speed ease of use and size were perfect for him he mostly uses it for music youtube and instagram all of which seem to work fine on it it was also very affordable he s happy with it so we are too,20
this item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing the only con is that amazon doesn t have some of the apps that google play has,20
i bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit i set it up with her as the user entered her age and name and now amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age simple to do and she loves the capabilities i also bought and installed a gig sd card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage for the price i think this tablet is best one out there you can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost,20
my kiddo loves this tablet she s and knows how to work it well i look at it sometimes and see apps that i didn t download lol good thing first year is free it s very durable as well great product overall i would ve liked a different color for her but blue was all that was in stock and i got it a great price being on sale plus i had certificates to use,20
with a seamless integration and easy functionality the echo show is wonderful piece of tech that is entertaining and useful to the whole family,20
love my mine works great with prime and i have all my best movies,20
works great for everything we want our daughter to do,20
great product and i m very satisfied with it i recommend it to other people,20
this is an awesome product this is the first echo product i owned and i purchased to get off i was going to split with a friend but like this so much that i decided to keep both i ve being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos the videos on youtube takes a more effort to find the ones i want but i think this will improve over time,20
i bought both of my children one of these tablets they love it,20
love using this kindle to look up real estate sales play mind games and take pictures love the bigger screen and the great resolution sound is also far superior to my older model lindle,20
i love my original kindle fire but the size and features on the latest kindle are a plus,20
this is actually for a gift second one i purchased but great priduct,20
this is excellent for toddlers and also as they grow numerous things they can do on it and also nice to be abke to control it as a parent,20
this is the most amazing item and very easy to use,20
purchased the show after i picked up the echo plus dot s a tap this smart home system is addictive and i will be adding more soon,20
meh it works i find it difficult to navigate i also have an ipad mini this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad,20
i don t know why i waited so long to bring alexa into my home it s how i listen to my music now dictate my shopping and to do lists and get my morning weather report just to name a few i highly recommend this item,20
my sons love playing on their tablet not only does it allow me additional time to get things done but they enjoy the educational apps provided,20
this is a great tablet for the price amazon is doing a good job,20
purchased as a gift for the family can t wait to use it,20
my son is and loves it it s very easy to use,20
it was great product the price which i got it was great,20
fantastic sound from such a small speaker excellent not as impressed with its other potential capabilities more difficult to set those up get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather order items etc wish it came with more pre installed i guess,20
i was given a fire when i was recuperating from spine surgery a few years ago i used it for everything for quite some time this one has a camera and plays all the latest files i still have and use the old one as well an excellent content delivery system i got it with best buy customer appreciation money what a deal,20
i have enjoyed using the fire hd it is fast and easy to use i also appreciate all the things it will do,20
amazon keeps getting better tablet now has option to move icons set wallpaper and more with added sd card option is even better,20
she hasn t used the it yet but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine,20
alexa is amazin i love the features their great just love it,20
this kindle fire is lighter than my old one the speed is great all apps load very quickly i also like that it comes in different colors,20
i bought it as a gift for my parents and they absolutely love it,20
easy to use wide variety of functions awesome price,20
speaker is pretty loud and i love that i can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the home button to use alexa,20
love how it hooks up to lights and can play any music,20
i bought this as a gift for christmas and it was well liked,20
better than nook also cheaper if toy areally looking to use as a tablet not the best choice great for reading and basic searching,20
the color is what got me and the features was on point the screen shows a lot of different displays to share for now until the next one,20
love the echo show allows me to control lights alarm vacuum and lots of stuff no brainer to set up make lists keep up with calendar plays music tells jokes and sings badly but is fun couldn t be happier with it,20
great tablet new to me so i have a lot to learn about it s functions,20
this is my second kindle have a few more items to learn but love it easy to get around the apps,20
i think the amazon fire offer should include a stand cover as standard i enjoy mine a lot more since i was forced to purchase a stand cover which holds the tablet would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use,20
its a lot more then we expected this is a wonderful addition to our tech life,20
this is a must have is great for recepies while you are cooking alexa gives you the info for the ines that are used to a tablet or ipod that you have to stop and read this is awesome plus so much easier to follow things,20
absolutely love kindle kids edition easy to use great apps and love it comes with year warranty must have for my kids,20
i like my show but i can t say i love it for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices it has probably the worst microphone getting it to respond is frustrating at times where i have no problem with a standard echo besides this it all works as advertised i d wait for the second generation i m sure they can work the kinks out,20
i would recommend this product it works great and ver compact,20
i got the first version for my sister and she hasn t been able to put it down on over a year then i got her this one and forget about it great new features she loves loves loves it,20
convenient easy to use and grand kids all have one too,20
i already have amazon devices echo s and dot s i expected this device to be slightly different as it is the only amazon device i have with a screen i was pleasantly surprised at the large number of helpful features that a screen could bring it occasionally scrolls suggestions across the screen and most of them have been very helpful i m planning on setting another one up at my year old mothers house she ll get a kick out of it also,20
this tablet is so great for school children to play and learn on,20
i really like this device right now i only have light sync d with it but looking forward to adding more another feature i like is the ability to put items on both my shopping and errand lists i can t wait to find out all the things it can do for me,20
nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity,20

my sons love playing on their tablet not only does it allow me additional time to get things done but they enjoy the educational apps provided,20
it s a nice upgrade from the screen size is just right for small kids hands reading kindle books is much easier,20

got it as a gift for my dad so far so good didn t not realise the special offers are ads spend more money to buy the one with out them also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection you now need wifi to connect to the store,20
absolutely love the echo show it is in my kitchen i love seeing my to do and shopping lists on there my calendar is there too plus i scroll pictures on it from my amazon prime photos love being able to get the daily news briefing from mpr every morning also use it for timing things would highly recommend it to amazon prime members got it at a great price on sale prior to christmas,20
i m very happy with my purchase i bought one because my wife has one and is very happy with hers,20
just what i was looking for to putin my guest room it has a good picture,20
works well and the speakers decent sounds much better than the nd generation of the echo,20
i bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale i ve been pleasantly surprised search sounds great for its size,20
this item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing the only con is that amazon doesn t have some of the apps that google play has,20
this works well as it was a gift and connected without issue along with the other two,20
the original electronic book bought it for my wife who reads paper book at two to three a week she s hooked and loves the kindle,20
so my month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet however my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my ipad but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys which makes the kindle fire tablet for kids the best invention since the tivo all the pre loaded apps videos books etc is nothing short of amazing the case is also very cool hardwood floor and stair case proof for under bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine,20
it s ok but i rather have bought samsung galaxy tab,20
if nothing else i have peace of mind that should she fall or need assistance then i can now better assist,20
fits nicely in your hand and its touchable increase the size of the fonts,20
durable worth every penny got it for our year old daughter amazed how easily she can navigate it,20
i use this hours a day whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo device the battery life sound quality and voice recognition is great,20
unable to try light bulb because it would not hook to echo plus waiting for rest of system,20
replaced my hd fire because broke screed very pleased with the large screen,20
she knows all the answers i m used to speaking to her i recently visiting a friend and said alexa and my friend looked at me like i was crazy she doesn t have alexa,20
the ultimate bluetooth speaker i have multiple amazon echos and a whole echo system set up in my house i love everything amazon i can t stand apple but now i know how they feel i am a cult member of amazon lol so anyway i have been trashing this device the tap because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things i like most about the echo the only flaw of the echo is it is not portable i tried the triby but i did not like it more for little kids so on black friday the amazon tap was on super sale so i bought it the tap is smaller than i thought it was about rd the size of the echo which is perfect for portability but don t let the size fool you the sound is only short of bose when it comes to volume and sound quality important note you don t have to have an echo to use this device just the alexa app on your smart phone the tap does everything the echo does it is an amazing bluetooth speaker and it s portable automatically switches remembers different wifi areas and can be used with a hot spot the most amazing thing about the whole amazon echo system is that amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does some things even better than google now and light years ahead of siri the tap is my new favorite device it is perfect the only flaw is that it is not waterproof amazon if you are listening make the next tap waterproof,20
love it works great one in each of the main rooms,20
nice size very clear but randomly shuts off cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen if you watch video it buffers alot and laggs,20
this is a nice and inexpensive tablet great for reading on or looking up info on the internet only downfall is you can t download some online games onto it,20
with the cover attached the battery lasts for a good long period with the cover detached which is how i use it primarily the oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand the ability to switch hands flip upside down means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book and it fits into my pants pocket again perfect for traveling the battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days but i tend to reconnect the cover at night i am assuming that helps to recharge the basic oasis battery regardless it was well worth replacing our older kindle readers with the newer oasis we bought two,20
this is a great tablet for the price amazon is doing a good job,20
i love my new kindle it is bigger than the last kindle i had this kindle is much easier to handle and to read,20
purchased this to get a lighter tablet also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery this is all around lighter thinner and easier to handle hd is a good upgrade and can t beat the price for comparable tablets with same features my wife reads on it daily and loves it i am probably going to search for another one we have the and i would like to try a if it were available i like to try different size devices to see how i adjust same way with todays phones,20
i got this for a really good price i already had the echo dot that i was kind of unimpressed with i love the echo show there are so many more things to do and the sound quality is great,20
bought for my grandson he loves playing with it and enjoys the videos,20
just what i was looking for to putin my guest room it has a good picture,20
best item i ever use i would love to get another one,20
we purchased the amazon echo show with alexa in store took it home and after connection wi fi it was great we cannot wait to buy light bulbs and a thermostat great buy,20
was good price wish it had google play download on to it,20
i purchased as a gift for father in law and he loves it,20
this has a lot of good features to limit the amount of time and what is accessed,20
i love it easy to use many different features,20
loved the fire hd but the latest hd is sharper faster and still handles great,20
works well and the speakers decent sounds much better than the nd generation of the echo,20
love using this kindle to look up real estate sales play mind games and take pictures love the bigger screen and the great resolution sound is also far superior to my older model lindle,20
with a price tag of this is one of the low end tablets with a lot of features but is certainly worth its price tag but it definitely lacks the features and hd display of its high end variant fire hd,20
i bought this tablet for my year old daughter too many advertisements i would rather pay more and not have a single ad,20
perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane,20
very impressed set up a little confusing but overall a good experience still learning however best buy emails give away any gift secrets had to reset my account to a work email address,20
with this you can make calls to other echo shows or using the app you can call others that have the a show i haven t used this feature yet since i m the only one i know who has one i can tell you that while using the app at home or away from home off the network you can call the show i did this while at work to check it out and caught my son coming in the back door i freaked him out but after he settled down we chatted via video chat for awhile and both agreed it was awesome you could also just drop into the show from the app to check on the house or whatever wherever you have it keep in mind you re only gonna see what it s pointed at the camera doesn t move plus in its natural form it is tilted back slightly so it point upward there are stands on amazon the correct the tilt to make it straight up and down almost forgot but the speakers are amazing you can link multiple echos together to play music i have the show in my living room an echo in my bedroom and the dot connected to a jbl speaker in another room after set up through the app i can tell alexa to play music and they all come to life,20
i love my amazon fire tablet i m sure my kids will love theirs too,20
i bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit i set it up with her as the user entered her age and name and now amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age simple to do and she loves the capabilities i also bought and installed a gig sd card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage for the price i think this tablet is best one out there you can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost,20
for those that have prime this is almost a must have keeps all your amazon stuff in one place,20
love this tablet it does everything i need it to my problem is i have family that falls in love with it so i give mine away if this wasn t good i wouldn t be on my rd one the only thing i would change is the silly ads and even worse browser other than that a solid product,20
great notepad huge screen and easily downloaded apps to use love it,20
the best product for the money east to use great color great features easy to set up and battery life is great,20
the echo plus is a fantastically easy to use smarthome hub it is easy to setup fast and responsive has a ton of capabilities that are expanding daily and looks and sounds great i currently use mine to manage my smart things like light bulbs lamps smart switches and even my robot vac it has made automating a lot of what i do daily a breeze and has simplified my life where i didn t know it needed to be simplified definitely worth the extra money to go with the plus over the echo or the dot,20
this product was purchased for my grandson he had a fire he however loves the hd he uses it for music gaming mostly great electronic device,20
bought of these for my and yr old and it said it came with gb storage but actual storage was a little less cant remember exactly how much probably around gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre installed they mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them there is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera love the product comes in different color as well i got the blue,20
the alexa show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that i had in the older device i m not sure if i m missing it in the show but i was able to get internet cameras on the older device such as san diego zoo elephants that you can t get on the show while certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch setup was pretty straight forward and easy it is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent it is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want such as play or start or open i use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then more or other combination you would have to set up several different alarms one for each day as far as i can see some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming i don t really want to be terrified awake each day i found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well it would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you d like i don t see that yet anywhere another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off if you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times i d rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe which is possible but very sensitive and if you miss here comes snooze just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly i am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so i can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time hoping that works well when it arrives it will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed all in all i d say it s a good emerging technology but needs a little work considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago it s kind of where we re heading,20
it can stream music really well and not just from amazon i was expecting it to be smart like watson but it is more like an blank stare amazon should look into predicting questions like during superbowl play offs alexa was unable to display or update the play off brackets it understands my voice really well were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what i am saying it want pair to my portable bluetooth speaker it will pair to my cell phone but only to receive music from it the audio quality is varies with amplitude with low amplitudes alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room but an amplitude setting of about the audio becomes clear and understandable i really like playing games like jeopardy with alexa no climbing through the closet to find a box anymore and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing,20
amazon kindle fire has a lot of free app and can be used by any one that wants to get online anywhere,20
this is my third kindle and the best one yet love the new controls the backlit page the compact size and the ease of use i would recommend the kindle voyage to all readers,20
my kiddo loves this tablet she s and knows how to work it well i look at it sometimes and see apps that i didn t download lol good thing first year is free it s very durable as well great product overall i would ve liked a different color for her but blue was all that was in stock and i got it a great price being on sale plus i had certificates to use,20
we returned it could not give answers to our questions even though the answers were easily found on google,20
we love kindle fire we purchase it for an older couple and it s easy to work,20
alexa is amazing and the phillips bulb works seamlessly with it,20
this tablet is great and easy to use very convenient and handy to have around,20
excellent speaker love the portability and long lasting battery before a recharge is needed a very good digital assistant and lots of fun to use,20
purchased the show after i picked up the echo plus dot s a tap this smart home system is addictive and i will be adding more soon,20
i got to say that love it makes it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my needs,20
we bought three including one for my year old we all love it the only complaint is the volume there is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers it doesn t bother us too much but that s why we give it stars overall a great tablet,20
this tablet is perfect for travel recently took it on a trip and the battery lasted the entire day with watching shows on and off on netflix great first tablet,20
i enjoy alexa she reminds me of appointment and alerts me when my packages arrive,20
i was jealous when our son showed us his amazon show and some of the things it was capable of doing since aol eliminated instant messaging my wife and i were less able to communicate because our offices are on separate floors so we got two shows and two spots and now not only can intercom easily but use alexa for music and many other things we will probably start using some smart home devices which alexa can also control it s a fun device which seems to be getting better all the time,20
i saw this product used by friends and was so impressed i bought one for my husband for christmas,20
bought for my husband for christmas we keep it in our kitchen and mainly just use it for music but our kids love that they can tell alexa to play a song they like and it plays,20
killer tablet for the price no issues running any apps or programs,20
this is a great tablet for kids and adults alike,20
took some time to get use to the kindle reader use to the ipad but i like that i can read without distractions,20
purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year amazon membership the recipient loves it and says it performs very well as a past amazon fire user now i pad graduate i loved my amazon fire for more than years without any problems in fact i just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ,20
i like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k,20
we love this so much in our home we bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it they love watching their movies on it and playing different apps it is a really good value,20
killer tablet for the price no issues running any apps or programs,20
it was too slow he didn t put any attention to it battery didn t last,20
i bought this for my wife this is her third amazon fire tablet she mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one she s very happy with it,20
very satisfied with product as do my family kids,20
the kindle is great for just reading books and the battery power is pretty good the experimental browser is not very user friendly,20
this is a nice little tablet for me since i don t do a lot on a tablet it s a great size it took a little getting use to working with but am a little more comfortable with it now,20
i love my kindle it is user friendly and there s so much more than i thought,20
i was reluctant to purchase the echo plus and my best friend said to do it you will love it i did and she was so right the philips hue light bulb was an added bonus and love that too,20
she loves it the only problem i have is getting it away from her even while riding in vehicles lol,20
i bought this for learning and entertaining purposes my daughter is enjoys it i compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price protection plan this works best for us,20
it was amazing everything was perfect and it came on time,20
lightweight and convenient to use love my new kindle,20
not a huge fan of products that aren t apple but this one is good haven t had any problems with them at all,20
i have really enjoyed my new echo plus i enjoy music every morning with the news,20
i am extremely happy with my purchase the kindle is very fast and the screen is clear,20
the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs it works well as promised,20
this product is amazing i wasn t quite sure why everyone was going on and on about having one but now that it s in my house i cannot imagine life without it alexa not only answers my questions and gives me valuable information but now she controls the lights of my house for me i highly recommend this,20
nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better,20
works well with smart home lights door locks and wireless security cam,20
this is a very good tablet the only con is you may have to reboot it too often,20
i picked this up after purchasing an echo i wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my echo i use both devices mostly for music it s great to be able to hear pandora or my amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone laptop etc i can just grab the tap and go anywhere in my house outside to the deck anywhere that i my wireless will reach,20
i like the echo show i can view my cams watch a movie and read the news the camera video is slightly delayed and i do wish it had a jack for earphones but the sound on mine is good,20
is good for the kids the only thing is i have to get a sd card for more memory,20
i have of these in my house work great i just bought for christmas gifts for my family,20
quite an upgrade from the original fire the deletion of the carousel was a welcome change the new turn style approach is faster and more consice still don t know why a chime sounds also miss the ease of making notes while reading there has got to be a better way to organize books trying to figure out series trilogies etc is impossible and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that amazon won t pick up a new purchase as a book already read,20
this is my eighth kindle some others were either lost or screen damaged i bought it as a spare current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen great price also wish i d bought two,20
i love my echo show i wish you could watch movies or tc shows or you tube so hopefully they will add that soon,20
we have bought two taps one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son we love the portability of the tap it s perfect for our deck our grandchildren love it too,20
this tablet works well for surfing the internet and playing music,20
i have dots and an echo and this just sounds better and looks better,20
i am pleasantly surprised at how well this works i bought the e reader and it didn t work so i was nervous buying this kindle but it works great and my son loves it,20
i love being able to use alexa she is an amazing ai until the robots rebel against the human kind i think it s worth it,20
i gave my paperwhite to a friend and bought the voyage i like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages i don t know that it s really worth all of the extra cost compared to the paperwhite especially since the new one just came out with dpi,20
requires too many components cameras etc stick with basics in my opinion,20
easy to handle light weight i like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed,20
i bought this for my grandson and it hasn t disappointed me at all he loves his tablet i am looking at buying his sister one next,20
i love my original kindle fire but the size and features on the latest kindle are a plus,20
great value just the right size and weight suits my needs perfectly performs very well easy to get accessories to fit,20
it was easy to set up and use best buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features,20
better than nook also cheaper if toy areally looking to use as a tablet not the best choice great for reading and basic searching,20
our whole family loves and uses this device for so many different features we love using it to make phone calls watch films play jeopardy even to define words as they come up in conversation we definitely get a lot of use out of this device more than any other screen tablet or smart phone device we own,20
the color is what got me and the features was on point the screen shows a lot of different displays to share for now until the next one,20
amazon s devices get better and better each release i ve had the original kindle fire and it s in no way an apple ipad replacement but what it does it does better than anyone it s a perfect starter tablet and perfect for a child the price keeps you from worrying about drops and the interface is easy to use,20
it works well and sounds decent but the hub portion of this is not as easy to use as samsung,20
i bought this for learning and entertaining purposes my daughter is enjoys it i compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price protection plan this works best for us,20
this is the best assistant from amazon with the completion of the screen you can also see images from cameras and other devices simply awesome,20
i love the the ability to video chat and watch videos on how to do stuff,20
excellent for what you pay and always good shopping at bestbuy,20
this was purchased for my older grandson age for christmas and as i stated in another review it has had games downloaded on it and will be ready to use when it is opened by him,20
love that i can control my lights with the phillips bulbs and is compatible with smart plugs to control other electronics in the house definitely would recommend,20
i purchase this tablet for my daughter s birthday and she absolutely loves it i am very pleased that she s not able to get online or to get on youtube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can t get into it i would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the google play store since it is an amazon tablet,20
bought for my son works great great tablet for the,20
i enjoy alexa she reminds me of appointment and alerts me when my packages arrive,20
it freezes a lot lots of problems getting games to cooperate but overall my son loves it,20
a little more complicated than my original kindle but i like it,20
great value from best buy bought at christmas sale,20
i didon t care for this tablet downloading apps outside of amazon was really confusing,20
bought this for my year old grandson who s a bit rough but loves to play games and read he loves it,20
easy to use no complains at all added all the smart plugs to the skills and works perfect,20
great for reading best part is its light weight and long battery life,20
i ve love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area that is what i got and more i very satisfied except it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and i am back to satisfaction,20
i am extremely happy with my purchase the kindle is very fast and the screen is clear,20
christmas gift for my son and my husband can t wait to hook it up,20
i bought two of these for my granddaughters and they are very easy to use and they love them,20
i m in love with alexa love her fir music quick weather updates and in the kitchen for recipes it s great getting them step by step and not having to keep putting the passcode in on my ipad with hands covered in flour,20
the apps are better it charges faster and the camera is really neat,20
it works about of the time when asking it a question,20
this a great tablet for everyone plenty of memory for downloading great features all around,20
i don t know why i waited so long to bring alexa into my home it s how i listen to my music now dictate my shopping and to do lists and get my morning weather report just to name a few i highly recommend this item,20
i love my echo show elexa is so helpfull she answers just about every question i have,20
this tablet is great and easy to use very convenient and handy to have around,20
i love my smart portable speaker it has games weather news podcasts radio stations etc if something is missing i can connect my bluetooth phone and stream whatever other audio application i want,20
the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale,20
hard to use and does not support guam online instructions not clear,20
bought this for my better half and she loves it it works very well with echo and has unlimited features,20
size brightness and convenience are good the option to link with android products for messages is a little hard,20
easy to set up we really enjoy getting real time local weather it translates spanish very efficiently we also enjoy the music we can easily select but would appreciate a higher quality sound linking the echo to lighting is a snap highly recommended,20
this is my second one and must have one of these at all times,20
i purchased this tablet for my year old son and he loves it great for movies games and reading books online definetly would recommend it as a starter tablet for young children the hard protective cover is a plus,20
gets use everyday by my girlfriend who i bought it for with no complaints also love the color also may get one for myself,20
bought of these for my and yr old and it said it came with gb storage but actual storage was a little less cant remember exactly how much probably around gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre installed they mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them there is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera love the product comes in different color as well i got the blue,20
the tablet is pretty good i would give it stars if you are able to download an use apps from the google store that is one of my only big complaint and also how fast the sd card got filled with items from amazon os that s on the tablet without the user knowing on the other hand with four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful,20
bought a few kindles in the past but this time one of it came defective the port was bent and it was hard to charge but still possible comes in different color was gb enough space for kids has camera ok quality not the best but ok for pics taken by kids,20
my family love alexa and so happy not having to buy any cd or another radio again,20
works well and the speakers decent sounds much better than the nd generation of the echo,20
i bought this for my wife and absolutely loves it alexa is so smart and helps my wife with everything like a personal assistant,20
bought it for my son wife they love it both thought they didn t need it they find that it is a lot of fun and very useful,20
good age appropriate learning tool for kids there is a variety of apps kids can download to keep them from getting bored overall a good tablet for the kids,20
unable to try light bulb because it would not hook to echo plus waiting for rest of system,20
good tablet gave as gift and person enjoys it recommend,20
i absolutely love my kindle i go nowhere without it it has kept me entertained for hours don t have to keep up with books that get torn or lost i would and do recommend a kindle for everyone,20
the color is what got me and the features was on point the screen shows a lot of different displays to share for now until the next one,20
i bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices my mother bought him a subscription to the abc mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on at first i was skeptical about spending the extra for the kids fire as i thought it was mainly for the case which i thought to be cheap silicon when the tablet arrived in the mail i was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick heavy duty type of foam it provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops it booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child s account the child s account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don t want them to get a hold of you can set time limits on their account to your desire you can allow and disallow any application you want to their account it comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited which i interpreted as basically prime for kids this allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want the kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate he is able to one click to any apps books games he wants to use it also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top overall i m very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the internet holds if you re not careful,20
a great new amazon device to add to my other alexa products the visuals are amazing and it is so easy to use and set up,20
this was one of the best birthday presents i ever purchased for my husband he said he doesn t use the computer but he was on my smartphone daily viewing fb i got him a drone for christmas and he needed something to view while it is flying i researched the kindle fire and thought he could practice with it until spring he farms so isn t busy in the winter thank goodness because he is busy with his kindle for hours every day he thinks it is great and i do too because now i have my phone back,20
love the sound i am able to plug in a lamp in a hard to reach spot since it is now voice activated,20
exchanged the google google home for this model fun for the kids finding new uses for it every day had a problem when best buy forgot to include the free light bulb,20
size brightness and convenience are good the option to link with android products for messages is a little hard,20
i love my kindle it is user friendly and there s so much more than i thought,20
this is my eighth kindle some others were either lost or screen damaged i bought it as a spare current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen great price also wish i d bought two,20
it would be nice to have full app library but it does what you need,20
highly impressed with my purchase allows me to use my ipad again since my years old granddaughter finally has her own tablet great support and numerous educational apps for children,20
we gave this tablet to our nine year old grandaughter for her birthday she loves it and we feel it is very sturdy that is a very good thing when it comes to tablets and children,20
was good price wish it had google play download on to it,20
this tablet is so great for school children to play and learn on,20
these things are cool with the new muti room music options i can have the same song playing in each room not to mention the intercom great item,20
the alexa show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that i had in the older device i m not sure if i m missing it in the show but i was able to get internet cameras on the older device such as san diego zoo elephants that you can t get on the show while certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch setup was pretty straight forward and easy it is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent it is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want such as play or start or open i use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then more or other combination you would have to set up several different alarms one for each day as far as i can see some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming i don t really want to be terrified awake each day i found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well it would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you d like i don t see that yet anywhere another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off if you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times i d rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe which is possible but very sensitive and if you miss here comes snooze just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly i am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so i can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time hoping that works well when it arrives it will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed all in all i d say it s a good emerging technology but needs a little work considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago it s kind of where we re heading,20
great tablet for my yr old love the profile options and parental controls,20
it has great speakers and is very easy to set up love my echo,20
it was amazing everything was perfect and it came on time,20
i tryed the gb to see if it was any different from the gb and found little difference may hold more apps,20
i love my new kindle it is bigger than the last kindle i had this kindle is much easier to handle and to read,20
great product that a whole family would enjoy it s a perfect addition to the household,20
i think the amazon fire offer should include a stand cover as standard i enjoy mine a lot more since i was forced to purchase a stand cover which holds the tablet would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use,20
amazon s devices get better and better each release i ve had the original kindle fire and it s in no way an apple ipad replacement but what it does it does better than anyone it s a perfect starter tablet and perfect for a child the price keeps you from worrying about drops and the interface is easy to use,20

great speaker able to move around connect to ipad when watching movies love it,20
i bought this for my wife this is her third amazon fire tablet she mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one she s very happy with it,20
lightweight and convenient to use love my new kindle,20
biting as a gift my only concern was the size and the amazon interface it was easy enough to download the google play store so it was familiar to the user size was an initial concern but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome,20
this product was purchased for my grandson he had a fire he however loves the hd he uses it for music gaming mostly great electronic device,20

a great value and i love it sounds great and works,20
the kids will have a lot of fun time with games and learning,20
my wife loves to read but she was always hesitant to try ebooks she used to think that ebooks could never have the same tactile feel as a physical book i talked her into it by telling her its lighter easier to hold can hold thousands of books and if she hated it we can return it but she loves ebooks now and doesnt want to go back she also found out that amazon has a lot of books which cost nothing namely classics and such i think if you like to read in the dark then get the paperwhite version the led s are a nice touch,20
got it as a gift for my dad so far so good didn t not realise the special offers are ads spend more money to buy the one with out them also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection you now need wifi to connect to the store,20
ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it larger screen and colored case are a big plus,20
very satisfied with product as do my family kids,20
gift for my great nephew and he really loves it he loves it so much that mom has to limit amount of time he allowed to play with it because he would play it,20
bought this for a gift for some one who s old tablet won t work just the right size to play games on,20
product is good light amazing battery backup i charge the kindle one in weeks great product for reasonable price usb connection is easy books are easy to download overall everyone must have kindle with them and this is the best product model to start with understandably this is the beginner level model for people who never used kindle before features like led lights white paper background are not available on this model these features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in dark without lights but again for this price you would not get any other good readers if you are someone who reads in dark then i would suggest go for higher kindle models,20
very happy and satisfiedeasier to handle fast charging,20
the amazon fire tablets are nice tablets they re especially great for streaming tv and movies and since it s a kindle it s great for books too it is a little odd with the internet browser and still a little limited in the app store but overall a great little tablet,20
the kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading,20
i purchased a echo for home so added a tap for my office at work so i can chat with alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent bt speaker for my office this has great sound streaming my prime music and xm vis the xm app can t go wrong quality music and alexa when i need some help with spelling hard word s she getting smart pick one up you have a woman to talk to when the wife is out,20
my wife purchased this for my daughter great for learning to read,20
got this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves that it is very convenient and easy to use,20
i can t update facebook and a few other apps it s not what i expected,20
it s not a regular tablet but i just use it to use facebook,20
i have enjoyed using the fire hd it is fast and easy to use i also appreciate all the things it will do,20
kid prof and comes with free books and games i like it,20
quite an upgrade from the original fire the deletion of the carousel was a welcome change the new turn style approach is faster and more consice still don t know why a chime sounds also miss the ease of making notes while reading there has got to be a better way to organize books trying to figure out series trilogies etc is impossible and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that amazon won t pick up a new purchase as a book already read,20
the tablet is very light and streams well i only use it to stream movies and it s much ligher then an ipad so makes mobility that much better,20
easy to set up but it does not work with all phones i have samsung,20
have been using this item and it seems to be working quite well,20
great choice battery life outstanding many kid friendly features,20
you can do some many things and the best part apps for free on amazon underground,20
bought as a gift for christmas they love it,20
my family love alexa and so happy not having to buy any cd or another radio again,20
it would be nice to have full app library but it does what you need,20
i bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son it s fast and easy to use,20
love the choice of colors have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift,20
i really enjoy the sound it sounds so full my only disappointment is the limited functionality of the built in hub i had to purchase the hue hub to get full functionality other than that i love it,20
my kids loved it they were able to learn how to use it right away,20
i use this thing every night to fall asleep although alexa don t always understand me i still love the device,20
this tablet is perfect for travel recently took it on a trip and the battery lasted the entire day with watching shows on and off on netflix great first tablet,20
i am enjoying my kindle very much easy to down load books and easy to read very happy with my purchase,20
i decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and i do not regret my decision at all the only con for those evaluating this as a tablet is that amazon has their own app store many apps from googleplay appstore are simply not available,20
added screen a great features visual effect a plus,20
size brightness and convenience are good the option to link with android products for messages is a little hard,20
love my mine works great with prime and i have all my best movies,20
works very well cheaper than an ipad and works great for apps and video,20
i like being able to ask about the weather set an alarm on my phone or create a shopping list all by just asking elexia,20
with this echo line we are able to watch amazon prime and even do visual calls to grand daughter,20
liked the first one so much i bought one for the wife,20
very nice easy to use got it to use with amazon prime great combo,20
i had an alexa but thought the show would be cool as it would allow me to link a camera to it see videos for info i wanted to look up play my prime video account it would have been a if i could see all prime shows movies on it,20
this is my third kindle the best differentiator is the form factor definite improvement over the paperwhite also like having the page turn buttons back case is very cool indeed if you can get past the jump in price remember you re not having to buy the case separately it s a quality product to have,20
very kid friendly especially for toddlers and easy to use,20
i bought my step mom an updated kindle she reads the new kindle more than her old one,20
the apps are better it charges faster and the camera is really neat,20
purchased as a christmas gift for my grandson he loved it,20
i love my smart portable speaker it has games weather news podcasts radio stations etc if something is missing i can connect my bluetooth phone and stream whatever other audio application i want,20
very handy to get the morning news as well as asking him to play music,20
i ve been using the original b n nook ereader for several years now i finally decided to upgrade i wish i d done it a lot sooner the new kindle touchscreen ereader is phenomenal the device is light and easy to carry almost unbelievably so it is fast and responsive and touch screen has delay i would recommend anybody in the market for this one buy one immediately you won t regret it,20
this was a christmas present for the nephew works good he loves it,20
i have both the kindle voyage and the low end kindle fire while the fire is an amazing deal for serious readin g the kindle voyage is far easier on the eyes and has superior resolution now it lacks many of the features of the less expensive fire such as color and online with wifi as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure truthfully it isn t a whole lot better than the paperwhite it has a feature or two but i m not sure it s worth the extra dollars it is still an excellent device,20
love this product i can ask questions and play music also link my lights to it,20
this is great product the tablet are made tough and great price,20
i needed a simple tablet to use in my car on long trips bought two of these and boy do they deliver the best tablets for this price the kindle book reader is an added bonus the finishing is good my kids love it,20
definitely worth the money the sound is awesome,20
great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on black friday,20
she love it she said it easy to use she love it very much,20
easy to handle light weight i like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed,20
this was a christmas present for my niece she loved it,20
love using this kindle to look up real estate sales play mind games and take pictures love the bigger screen and the great resolution sound is also far superior to my older model lindle,20
we use alexa for so many things we use it for shopping list music lights on or off even trivia games,20
i have only used this a few times so far but i like it the lightweight and pretty easy to navigate perfect screen size too i ended up purchasing a second one for my fianc,20
i love my new amazon fire tablet it s great the perfect size to fit in my purse so that i can take it with me i would definitely recommend to a friend,20
purchased one for my older son last year got this second d one for the younger one so they don t fight over them,20
easy to use wide variety of functions awesome price,20
i am an old traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books now i don t lose what page i was on and have more shelf space where books used to be,20
good price works well best buy sales associate was very helpful in selecting this product,20
the kids will have a lot of fun time with games and learning,20
kid friendly great appschild can learn many things with this tablet,20
my son really enjoys this its his first tablet he is and had no problem learning how to use it,20
great tablet for my and year old kid friendly safe and mom and dad enjoy it as well love that it comes in a protective case reasonably priced for a great tablet the kids love,20
i bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire so far it has exceeded my expectations all my apps have transferred flawlessly the battery lasts me hours with moderate internet use glad i made this purchase,20
i m not a techie but after days of trying to hook up i gave up i don t know if it was the echo plus or my carrier att uverse causing the issue but it would not connect so back to the store it went even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistance none of it worked,20
has built in smart hub unlike other echos works with other smart home devices with no additional purchases,20
this makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition but i m not sure i d want it as an adult there are much better tablets on the market but since it s cheap that s to be expected,20
i bought this as a gift for my daughter s nd birthday and she totally loved it now she s wanting me to buy a second one so that i can keep it on the first floor she says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other i think it was a great purchase so i think i m going to have to buy another one,20
this tablet works well for surfing the internet and playing music,20
i love the echo alexa is awesome it was a christmas present also received two dots to place in other rooms,20
good small tablet for all purposes for reading playing games,20
this is my eighth kindle some others were either lost or screen damaged i bought it as a spare current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen great price also wish i d bought two,20
i bought it for my son in laws birthday after they bought me one for christmas not just good for music but helpful for grandkids homework and now we can video chat with grandkids which the one year old loves,20
perfect size for me speaker clarity is amazing and produces a great picture,20
bought it for my husband and he loves it this is perfect for what he wanted it for,20
nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity,20
excellent product turns on and off supported devices by asking it live walking into a room and asking alexa to turn on a light poof it s done or locking and unlocking the front door arming and disarming my security system if you re looking to turn your house into a smarthome i strongly recommend the amazon echo plus,20
great device and easy setup the ease of use for the kids are also great,20
these were ordered one for year old and then ordered second one for year old they are easy to use and age appropriate apps for each of them,20
works very well easy to carry around connect to wifi,20
its a great product but for the cost the speakers are not what they should be and the screen is too small choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot i am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance,20
we have always been nexus tablet desciples and in fact have bought of them for self and family members this one was for granddaughter to replace nexus that had gotten slow this one works better faster than the nexus it s fast easy to use perfect tablet for a child or teenager and can t beat the price very pleased with purchase,20

this is great my daughters first tablet and it came with everything she needed to get started she loves the pink bumper guard and so do i for the safety,20
i love everything about this alexa if you re on the fence just buy it it does everything,20
the display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good probably better for reading than watching videos we didn t really get it for the games but there is a good selection wifi works well and internet browsing is fast,20
i was using the original echo seldomly then i decided to get the show i use the show a lot more was simple to set up and you can make calls with video great product,20

i have had a kindle for some time and was curious about the oasis it did not disappoint it is very compact even with the cover and fits in a coat pocket i really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons great device for home or on the go,20
love the color just the right size easy to set up works well for what i needed it for great price,20

this product is easy to use and take along with you,20
i have both the kindle voyage and the low end kindle fire while the fire is an amazing deal for serious readin g the kindle voyage is far easier on the eyes and has superior resolution now it lacks many of the features of the less expensive fire such as color and online with wifi as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure truthfully it isn t a whole lot better than the paperwhite it has a feature or two but i m not sure it s worth the extra dollars it is still an excellent device,20
very handy to get the morning news as well as asking him to play music,20
loved the fire hd but the latest hd is sharper faster and still handles great,20
i bought this for learning and entertaining purposes my daughter is enjoys it i compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price protection plan this works best for us,20
the display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good probably better for reading than watching videos we didn t really get it for the games but there is a good selection wifi works well and internet browsing is fast,20
i received an original echo two years ago and use it in my office this year i decided to get one for the house and was amazed at all the features i hadn t taken advantage of primarily the smart home features this was great because it came with a lightbulb,20

my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her kindle,20
was told by sales person i could come back in a week with receipt to get off black friday price customer service lady said they don t do that i was misled item itself is okay,20
awesome product my wife and i love it makes home automation simple,20
we love this so much in our home we bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it they love watching their movies on it and playing different apps it is a really good value,20
i am an old traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books now i don t lose what page i was on and have more shelf space where books used to be,20
i bought this for my grandson and it hasn t disappointed me at all he loves his tablet i am looking at buying his sister one next,20
i really like this device right now i only have light sync d with it but looking forward to adding more another feature i like is the ability to put items on both my shopping and errand lists i can t wait to find out all the things it can do for me,20
this is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device,20
bought for my grandson he loves playing with it and enjoys the videos,20
this works well as it was a gift and connected without issue along with the other two,20
i tryed the gb to see if it was any different from the gb and found little difference may hold more apps,20
i bought it for my son in laws birthday after they bought me one for christmas not just good for music but helpful for grandkids homework and now we can video chat with grandkids which the one year old loves,20
everything i expected with none of the drawbacks i have found in other tablets,20
this is a great tablet for the price amazon is doing a good job,20
other similar devices do not have the voice recognition learning capability the echo plus has it is superior to all the others,20
i ve wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when bb put it on sale i am not disappointed,20
bought it on sale for christmas gift and we ll worth the money does everything needed with good functionality easy to use for those not too tech savvy,20
i bought shows and i am loving them them video flash briefing are wonderful and personalized i don t have to keep my phone on me to keep in touch with my closest family members they can just drop in and i can do the same with the kids when away from the house i made more purchases immediately after to put them in my office and living room i love the lyrics when music is playing and looking at the forecast on the fly they are a must have for a modern home,20
i waited a couple months to review giving amazon time to make this product equal to the sony dash from nearly a decade ago it isn t the screen provides nothing of value and you can t turn of amazon tips you have near zero customization can t even move the clock to the other side of the screen and something that a sony dash did nearly years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm seriously this is the biggest fail run away from this half baked amazon disaster,20
she loves it the only problem i have is getting it away from her even while riding in vehicles lol,20
it was good works pretty easily the camera is good,20
i bought this second kindle for the larger storage space and love all the extra stuff i can do now,20
limited apps and a bit thicker than ipad but works,20
purchased this for my wife during christmas and got a great deal on it compared to the older version that she has this model is faster brighter and more convenient with alexa i would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it,20
great tablet perfect for my year old son,20
i thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm i think it is too small to read on it not very comfortable as regular kindle would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead,20
easy to set up but it does not work with all phones i have samsung,20
this is a great product at a great price i would definitely recommend this to anybody especially good for college students or people that read books etc,20
not a huge fan of products that aren t apple but this one is good haven t had any problems with them at all,20
we brought this as a replacement for the fifteen to fifty books my daughter wanted to take with her to hawaii books of course would weigh a lot and there be no room for cloths pesky airline and their poundage issues now she can take a hundred books and she has a mini computer it s a win win but no win for the airlines,20
we love the parent controls and durability we would definitely buy another,20
alexa with screen love it works perfectly with my ring doorbell,20
super easy to setup for the kids to use parental controls are a bonus,20
i love this tablet i got one for each one of the kids all different ages and they all love it,20
this is a great tablet for kids as it is not too expensive and there is a year warranty if it breaks within years they replace it my year is very rough with things my husband was letting him plug the charger in by himself and jammed it into the tablet causing the charging port to break i had no problems getting it replaced,20
when used with amazon prime and the freetime app for kids this is a great tablet recommend installing at least gb of micro sd card storage and install apps to the card to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos easy enough to use for our year old grandson,20
has built in smart hub unlike other echos works with other smart home devices with no additional purchases,20
i waited a couple months to review giving amazon time to make this product equal to the sony dash from nearly a decade ago it isn t the screen provides nothing of value and you can t turn of amazon tips you have near zero customization can t even move the clock to the other side of the screen and something that a sony dash did nearly years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm seriously this is the biggest fail run away from this half baked amazon disaster,20
my wife s old kindle stopped holding a charge so to surprise her i stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle this kindle is great its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life my wife uses it every day this is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget,20
too difficult to setup not compatible with other equipment,20
exactly what i was looking for size wise and functional,20
this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s in but this is about cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s was not doing it for me,20
i like the visual with this echo although i think i would have enjoyed it more if this was my first and only alexa,20
my kiddo loves this tablet she s and knows how to work it well i look at it sometimes and see apps that i didn t download lol good thing first year is free it s very durable as well great product overall i would ve liked a different color for her but blue was all that was in stock and i got it a great price being on sale plus i had certificates to use,20
i bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit i set it up with her as the user entered her age and name and now amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age simple to do and she loves the capabilities i also bought and installed a gig sd card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage for the price i think this tablet is best one out there you can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost,20
this has a lot of good features to limit the amount of time and what is accessed,20
bought this to carry around for internet and gaming so far very happy,20
great for first time tablet but more advanced options available,20
i love the capability to see it on the screen and it allows me to not have to use my hands,20
great product i will recommend this to all of my family and friends,20
with this echo line we are able to watch amazon prime and even do visual calls to grand daughter,20
information on weather updates on music events fun questions answered while working in kitchen good sound for a limited areagreat sales assistance at best buy,20
wife love it reads a lot and this is her go to reader,20
this a great tablet for everyone plenty of memory for downloading great features all around,20
the only thing i have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device why is that,20
the amazon fire hd is one of the best deals on the market i ve had a ipad and would rather have the hd it s what of the price of a ipad and just as good if not better,20
i previously owned a nucleus device which was similar to this device but was not a great device and had a lot of bugs and did not do much so i returned it this device is a masterpiece not only is it tied into the alexa echo universe it can be used as an intercom throughout your house with other echos and also can be used to view things and even call people that have echo directly it is an amazing piece of hardware and amazon should be proud of themselves for developing such a beautiful device,20
i love my amazon fire tablet i m sure my kids will love theirs too,20
amazon keeps getting better tablet now has option to move icons set wallpaper and more with added sd card option is even better,20
it does everything amazon and i can even see who is at the front door with arlo it doesn t do netflix or hulu but that s okay i really like the sound it fills small rooms it s easy now to video chat with nana or drop in to tell my kid s goodnight when i am working late,20
bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it it s so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls,20
my year old son really enjoys the tablet it s great,20
looks nice can t wait to try it out great price for a tablet,20
works well with smart home lights door locks and wireless security cam,20
bought of these for christmas for my family members i ve had mine for a year in my kitchen and just love it so much you can do with it and works great with my arlo pro cameras big plus amazon is always updating the show to do more,20
plays all my ipod music via bluetooth also plays radio stations you can t get on a regular radio very practical and fun,20
purchased for my mom in a memory care center she doesn t have to answer the phone we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us picture clarity awesome staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently doesn t replace room camera but good would give a but can t figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her anyone know,20
great product and i m very satisfied with it i recommend it to other people,20
bought for my grandson he loves playing with it and enjoys the videos,20
amazon keeps getting better tablet now has option to move icons set wallpaper and more with added sd card option is even better,20
so many things you can use it for love working my lights,20
the system is able to react quickly to the verbal directions it even is able to pickup voices across the room and seems to capture the commands accurately even when spoken quickly,20
bought a few kindles in the past but this time one of it came defective the port was bent and it was hard to charge but still possible comes in different color was gb enough space for kids has camera ok quality not the best but ok for pics taken by kids,20
i bought this for reading listening books love the availability to expand the memory now i can load movies and tons of books,20
with this echo line we are able to watch amazon prime and even do visual calls to grand daughter,20
my husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home he likes to have shows and movies to watch this has so much space for him to download things to watch,20
everything i expected with none of the drawbacks i have found in other tablets,20
i can t update facebook and a few other apps it s not what i expected,20
i saw this product used by friends and was so impressed i bought one for my husband for christmas,20
amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far the only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don t have to tap every command that would make it a star device,20
perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane,20
i bought this as a gift for my grandkids they absolutely love it,20
great sound love the music and the electrical devices you can work with it,20
my kid love this tablet the setup was so easy and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps that my kid can enjoy playing and learning,20
this is a great tablet for kids and adults alike,20
i bought this as a backup i am currently using the same headphone,20
i have the echo and a dot this is great for video calling and intercom calling in the house use it every day i run all my photo s stored on amazon prime and for music,20
this has been an exceptional hit for us she totally loves it,20
great speaker and the sound is great use it every day love being able to use alexa when attached to my network,20
so i was skeptical of echo show and the entire line to be honest however this technology has changed how our household operates from my daily briefing in the morning to tracking santa with my year old every morning learning interesting facts about santa and several other things i truly wish i would have bought this sooner we have it integrated into our cozi account so we can just ask alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in we also have adt pulse and a nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple i couldn t believe it my son loves to ask alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is i am loving the amazon music now as well because we bought an echo dot just to integrate into our bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now if you are on the fence about getting the echo show like i was just do it it really is an amazing product,20
these were ordered one for year old and then ordered second one for year old they are easy to use and age appropriate apps for each of them,20
we love kindle fire we purchase it for an older couple and it s easy to work,20
this was one of the best birthday presents i ever purchased for my husband he said he doesn t use the computer but he was on my smartphone daily viewing fb i got him a drone for christmas and he needed something to view while it is flying i researched the kindle fire and thought he could practice with it until spring he farms so isn t busy in the winter thank goodness because he is busy with his kindle for hours every day he thinks it is great and i do too because now i have my phone back,20
awseome tablet for kids i would recommend this tablet for all age groups,20
replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon with electronics in the cabin under scrutiny this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill perfect in small purses and large pockets i can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you re holding it,20
i bought this tablet for my year old daughter too many advertisements i would rather pay more and not have a single ad,20
my wife loves this tablet much easier to use than previous tablets that we purchased,20
this was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books couple this with amazon gift cards and the library is endless,20
purchased the show after i picked up the echo plus dot s a tap this smart home system is addictive and i will be adding more soon,20
this is a nice and inexpensive tablet great for reading on or looking up info on the internet only downfall is you can t download some online games onto it,20
this is a great product at a great price i would definitely recommend this to anybody especially good for college students or people that read books etc,20
the best product for the money east to use great color great features easy to set up and battery life is great,20
my mom bought the tablets first for my sisters for christmas an then my year old wanted one so i purchased one for her she loves it uses it for games netflix an she is home school so she is able to do her work on the tablet as well,20
nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity,20
pleased with alexa have not used light yet i ll update after use,20
bought for daughter in law and she likes it she wanted a fire,20
i love everything about this alexa if you re on the fence just buy it it does everything,20
bought for my kids and they love them they love the camera,20
this little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming my kids have quickly learned that alexa is their personal dj when hooked up to the amazon prime unlimited music program battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass but it does the job for our family,20
bought it for my son wife they love it both thought they didn t need it they find that it is a lot of fun and very useful,20
amazon kindle is always the best ebook upgrade every new model,20
having fun with all the things we can learn from alexa it is almost like having another person in the house,20
i purchased this for my and year old grandchildren they were using parents phones and running the battery down now they have their own device and can watch their cartoons and play games love the case it makes it easy for little hands to hold on to overall very good purchase,20
this has a lot of good features to limit the amount of time and what is accessed,20
i read a huge number of books in kindle format this kindle fire is perfect for that it s just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying it also is great for audible users you will want to install a micro sd card though you can also use it to watch netflix and the like although i don t as a tablet it leaves a lot to be desired if you are looking for a tablet give this a pass it has a lot of system lag and wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal also you should know that you can t access any apps on the google play store it s locked into amazon none of that bothers me because like i said i only use it to read listen to kindle books and this device works perfectly for that bottom line if you just want a kindle reading platform with some extra functionality this will work well for you if you re looking for the full android tablet experience look elsewhere,20
i love the echo alexa is awesome it was a christmas present also received two dots to place in other rooms,20
amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far the only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don t have to tap every command that would make it a star device,20
my daughter absolutely love her tablet and i love it to for her it s very kids friendly,20
i gave my paperwhite to a friend and bought the voyage i like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages i don t know that it s really worth all of the extra cost compared to the paperwhite especially since the new one just came out with dpi,20
limited apps and a bit thicker than ipad but works,20
good for beginners play games take picture and recording videos old the time,20
product is great it is easy to use and easy to set up,20
i bought this tablet for my year old grand daughter and she loves it we set the parental controls for her age group and now we don t have to worry about what she is doing on it we downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it and now she has her own little private movie theater it also works great with our amazon fire tv and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows this is a great buy for the money and i recommend it to everyone,20
i m loving this new fire mainly because i didn t fork out a couple hundred for it my only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an ipad so don t look great on this,20
this a great tablet for everyone plenty of memory for downloading great features all around,20
when you can get this thing on sale it s an amazing deal have all of your amazon features right in your face books manga gaming amazon it s easy to hold has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen sure the galaxy tablets have better specs but it s the price and features you get from amazon that make this device amazing,20
i am an old traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books now i don t lose what page i was on and have more shelf space where books used to be,20
we bought one of these for our year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a christmas present for a year old parent it obviously isn t the highest quality tablet on the market but it very responsive and gets the job done and you can t beat the price just a great value,20
was a gift and they love the tablet its a great price and works awesome,20
this product is amazing i wasn t quite sure why everyone was going on and on about having one but now that it s in my house i cannot imagine life without it alexa not only answers my questions and gives me valuable information but now she controls the lights of my house for me i highly recommend this,20
gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games he loved it it s simple to use and inexpensive,20
we love the parent controls and durability we would definitely buy another,20
i bought this as a gift so i haven t gotten to use it much yet the initial setup was really easy and i am sure that she is going to love it,20
i bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints,20
great product i will recommend this to all of my family and friends,20
fantastic tablet fire one is great small and portable,20
this was a great tablet for the price for my wife perfect size and good for traveling,20
i bought shows and i am loving them them video flash briefing are wonderful and personalized i don t have to keep my phone on me to keep in touch with my closest family members they can just drop in and i can do the same with the kids when away from the house i made more purchases immediately after to put them in my office and living room i love the lyrics when music is playing and looking at the forecast on the fly they are a must have for a modern home,20
i love this tablet it s the perfect size for my kid keeps him entertained during long trips we picked up the free time kid proof case and it s perfect also,20
i have enjoyed learning about home automation using echo plus and consumers need to know that this comes with having to buy additional equipment to get the most out of alexa,20
i bought this tablet for it s inexpensive price and quality it s meant to be a portal to be able to purchase more products from amazon and services but it really is a high quality product,20
i love the alexa system of assistance this version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won t get to have to the option to pick up you need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private i installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use,20
we love alexa great addition to our family lol but seriously you can rely on alexa,20
i bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices my mother bought him a subscription to the abc mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on at first i was skeptical about spending the extra for the kids fire as i thought it was mainly for the case which i thought to be cheap silicon when the tablet arrived in the mail i was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick heavy duty type of foam it provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops it booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child s account the child s account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don t want them to get a hold of you can set time limits on their account to your desire you can allow and disallow any application you want to their account it comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited which i interpreted as basically prime for kids this allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want the kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate he is able to one click to any apps books games he wants to use it also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top overall i m very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the internet holds if you re not careful,20
my brother told me about this product i bought it for my son and he loves it,20
i am totally addicted easy to use love the call feature,20
this was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books couple this with amazon gift cards and the library is endless,20
purchased as a christmas gift for my grandson he loved it,20
great tablet perfect for my year old son,20
nice device good to enable drop in conversations some flash briefings but overall still a little limited in effective use of video,20
i purchased this for my and year old grandchildren they were using parents phones and running the battery down now they have their own device and can watch their cartoons and play games love the case it makes it easy for little hands to hold on to overall very good purchase,20
great tablet for price display is clear enjoy books on tablet,20
this ia a great product more technology to make your life easier,20
perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane,20
easy to use for a year old she loves it i just don t like that my amazon account is linked to her tablet,20
family is having fun with alexa i do like the way it integrates with other devices around the home arlo nest,20
fantastic product and does exactly as described great gift idea,20
i enjoy alexa she reminds me of appointment and alerts me when my packages arrive,20
a great new amazon device to add to my other alexa products the visuals are amazing and it is so easy to use and set up,20
i am so glad that i bought this echo it has made it easier to automate my music and my lights throughout my house we are still learning to use it but hope to add our thermostat as well to the items i can control with my alexa,20
quite an upgrade from the original fire the deletion of the carousel was a welcome change the new turn style approach is faster and more consice still don t know why a chime sounds also miss the ease of making notes while reading there has got to be a better way to organize books trying to figure out series trilogies etc is impossible and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that amazon won t pick up a new purchase as a book already read,20
can use many differents apps from the echo show awesome product,20
easy to use and elegant in design perfect gift for kids,20
this was a perfect tablet for my year old it does everything that she needed it to,20
powerful and quality sound love the portability just don t understand why this one can t read my notifications while the dot can,20
this is my second fire wanted a larger size to make ebooks easier to read very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet easy to take along in a tote perfect for what i wanted it for,20
i had an older version of a kindle e reader that allowed me to download books on the go but i felt like something was missing several upgrades later i got this for a gift and i think it basically includes everything that was missing it is so lightweight and compact that i can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand it has backlighting that doesn t disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting it s just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths it can self adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day,20
unable to try light bulb because it would not hook to echo plus waiting for rest of system,20
quite an upgrade from the original fire the deletion of the carousel was a welcome change the new turn style approach is faster and more consice still don t know why a chime sounds also miss the ease of making notes while reading there has got to be a better way to organize books trying to figure out series trilogies etc is impossible and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that amazon won t pick up a new purchase as a book already read,20
it was just as described i would recommend it to a friend,20
she loves it the only problem i have is getting it away from her even while riding in vehicles lol,20
alexa walks you through every step which i found helpful,20
tablet works will with amazon video on our smart tvs as well as the firesticks,20
good price works well best buy sales associate was very helpful in selecting this product,20
i was resistant to putting down my real books and begin using a kindle i m so glad i did it s so convenient to shop and instantly download a book plus no more storing hundreds on books in my house,20
absolutely love kindle kids edition easy to use great apps and love it comes with year warranty must have for my kids,20
enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do initially disappointed by the small size but i quickly learned to appreciate it very portable and convenient i wanted something easy on the eyes with a g connection so i did not have to be connected to wifi to download books was a bit more then i wanted to pay but feel i will get good use out of it,20
i originally got the lower end kindle took it back and upgraded the light really is a must i can t believe how much more i m reading now that i have it and there are tons of free books out there if you know where to look best purchase ever,20
i absolutely love my kindle i go nowhere without it it has kept me entertained for hours don t have to keep up with books that get torn or lost i would and do recommend a kindle for everyone,20
the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs it works well as promised,20
i love to use alexa to listen to music set timer alarms and ect my parents use the show to show the cameras and stuff for a second control panel to their security system,20
requires too many components cameras etc stick with basics in my opinion,20
i love my echo show elexa is so helpfull she answers just about every question i have,20
the alexa show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that i had in the older device i m not sure if i m missing it in the show but i was able to get internet cameras on the older device such as san diego zoo elephants that you can t get on the show while certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch setup was pretty straight forward and easy it is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent it is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want such as play or start or open i use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then more or other combination you would have to set up several different alarms one for each day as far as i can see some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming i don t really want to be terrified awake each day i found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well it would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you d like i don t see that yet anywhere another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off if you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times i d rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe which is possible but very sensitive and if you miss here comes snooze just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly i am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so i can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time hoping that works well when it arrives it will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed all in all i d say it s a good emerging technology but needs a little work considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago it s kind of where we re heading,20
fantastic product and does exactly as described great gift idea,20
this was a christmas present the person that received it was very happy with it she has other kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones,20
very handy to get the morning news as well as asking him to play music,20
this fire worked great but i returned it because it was not the one i wantedbest buy took it back for a full refund with no problems best buy is alsome,20
this is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device,20
this a great tablet for everyone plenty of memory for downloading great features all around,20
my kid love this tablet the setup was so easy and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps that my kid can enjoy playing and learning,20
upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras sound is much better,20
i bought of these for gifts i love my echo and think the new one will be incredible too after the holidays i will buy one for myself,20
my yr old grand daughter loves her new tablet now she can watch mickey clubhouse whenever she wants,20
i originally got the lower end kindle took it back and upgraded the light really is a must i can t believe how much more i m reading now that i have it and there are tons of free books out there if you know where to look best purchase ever,20
i enjoy my kindle immensely so much better than having to start up my computer,20
screen is really nice great for videos i would definetly recommend it,20
i recently had purchased enough smart home devices to make this a good addition for the home it works well with smart outlets our ring doorbell and fairly well with our nest thermostat my only complaint is that sometimes for no reason it will start plying a movie trailer and it s hard to get it to stop still all in all we re happy with the purchase,20
this is great my daughters first tablet and it came with everything she needed to get started she loves the pink bumper guard and so do i for the safety,20
bought this for my year old he loves it and it s very simple to add the perfect parental controls,20
i bought this for my grandson and it hasn t disappointed me at all he loves his tablet i am looking at buying his sister one next,20
i have all the echo products in this by far is the best it does everything i love it,20
this tablet does a great deal from surfing the net to watching movie and using all of the music channels this is an affordable way to stay in touch also i use it for ebooks for school,20
love playing music and talking to alexa and looking at my camera three the screen,20
the best tablet for kids the year unlimited apps is my favorite my kids love it,20
easy to set up we really enjoy getting real time local weather it translates spanish very efficiently we also enjoy the music we can easily select but would appreciate a higher quality sound linking the echo to lighting is a snap highly recommended,20
its a great product but for the cost the speakers are not what they should be and the screen is too small choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot i am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance,20
great tablet perfect for my year old son,20
this is great product the tablet are made tough and great price,20
replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon with electronics in the cabin under scrutiny this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill perfect in small purses and large pockets i can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you re holding it,20
it is a solid product great for kids i like it a lot,20
my kiddo loves this tablet she s and knows how to work it well i look at it sometimes and see apps that i didn t download lol good thing first year is free it s very durable as well great product overall i would ve liked a different color for her but blue was all that was in stock and i got it a great price being on sale plus i had certificates to use,20
bought for my grandson he loves playing with it and enjoys the videos,20
it is a solid product great for kids i like it a lot,20

i got it for me and my brother for christmas great gift great price very functional,20
the grandkids love this tablet easy for them to use,20
i was pleasantly surprised to see the kindle for sale in the store i love my kindle especially since i was able to expand the memory i love that it s portable to be honest when given the choice i find my self on my kindle over my laptop the only thing i can complain about is why in the world amazon choose s to make it nearly a miracle to find a case for its most popular model if you don t have a kindle you don t know what your missing,20
just got this in the mail last night setting it up today and i want to love it the kicker for me buying it was being able to connect our arlo cameras and view instantly the display in the store had great sound,20
using the kindle to read books and stream videos is very easy and enjoyable,20
i just love this tap it is so much fun the music is so great i play the relation music every night every night best thing ever,20
i am enjoying my kindle very much easy to down load books and easy to read very happy with my purchase,20
makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that i can see a whole page at one time the protective cover that best buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the on off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that i had to find another cover from another source,20
everything i expected with none of the drawbacks i have found in other tablets,20
great tablet for web access and works well gaming no reason to spend more unless you need a larger screen,20
i think the amazon fire offer should include a stand cover as standard i enjoy mine a lot more since i was forced to purchase a stand cover which holds the tablet would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use,20
we bought this reader to replace a fire hdx that had seemed to go wonky turns out a couple of system resets and the hdx is back to normal so i get the old one she gets the new one but i can highly recommend this reader the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent,20
it was amazing everything was perfect and it came on time,20
i talk myself into the g and i am so glad i did i have used only kindles for the past years and i love them i love the color as well,20
my echo show is my christmas gift to myself so far i am having great fun with this nifty new addition to my amazon family of home monitoring devices i have connected the show to my ring doorbell,20
great resolution easy to use amazon prime gives you free movies books and games,20
the amazon fire hd is one of the best deals on the market i ve had a ipad and would rather have the hd it s what of the price of a ipad and just as good if not better,20
great screen resolution and easy to use battery life is really good,20
nicer than my old fire better screen area to view,20
the ease of use and comparability with smart home products make a this an awesome product,20
very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don t work very well charging port very low quality,20
i just love every thing about it its awesome to read,20
fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything,20
bought for our son so he wouldn t have to carry books back from his deployment,20
product is great it is easy to use and easy to set up,20
this has been a very nice addition it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it,20
i m normally an apple snob but needed a cheap tablet and was very surprised how functional the amazon fire is,20

the color is what got me and the features was on point the screen shows a lot of different displays to share for now until the next one,20
this is the main reason why i went with amazon s echo ecosystem vs google home i bought one as a gift to my sister so i can easily videochat with my family my niece and nephew tend to fight over the echo show when they want to sing along to their favorite songs with the lyrics on the screen my only wish was that there was an hdmi out to connect it to a larger monitor huge missed opportunity in my opinion,20
the kids love it they ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer i really like for the music aspect just tell it a song and it finds it,20
i purchased two of these tablets as a gift for christmas it has an exceptional hd screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book articles etc,20
the family and i love alexa view and once we got it we were hooked now everything in the house and outside is run by voice commands the opportunities with this are endless,20

seems a lot better does not have the open cover feature which i miss but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that i had on the old,20
i love the alexa system of assistance this version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won t get to have to the option to pick up you need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private i installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use,20
this is my eighth kindle some others were either lost or screen damaged i bought it as a spare current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen great price also wish i d bought two,20
amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up,20
this was a great purchase with one hue bulb included with the echo plus installation set up was a breeze,20
my year old mom loves this she now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices loves to read do crosswords etc,20

got this for my year old granddaughter and she loves it uses it for game play homework etc mom and dad loves the parental controls not having to worry so much,20

super easy to setup for the kids to use parental controls are a bonus,20
the echo show is a great accessory to any house it has a great picture on it and great sound it s simple to use my wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists also listens to music with crisp sound can ask alexa pretty much anything,20
has been very durable with kids and easy to use great product for price,20
the kindle fire is small but does everything it should for a young child worth the low cost i paid for it,20

i have dots and an echo and this just sounds better and looks better,20
as good as echo with added visuals can be usefuland fun,20

love playing music and talking to alexa and looking at my camera three the screen,20

requires too many components cameras etc stick with basics in my opinion,20
i use this hours a day whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo device the battery life sound quality and voice recognition is great,20
easy to use for a year old she loves it i just don t like that my amazon account is linked to her tablet,20
got this for my year old granddaughter and she loves it uses it for game play homework etc mom and dad loves the parental controls not having to worry so much,20
i bought two of these for my granddaughters and they are very easy to use and they love them,20
bought this for my year old grandson who s a bit rough but loves to play games and read he loves it,20
amazon echo products are terrific and and quite helpful imagine taking the alexa voice and adding some video to it really cool great for the kitchen where you can use it for recipes as well as music and other things,20
awesome product my wife and i love it makes home automation simple,20
has everything you will ever need inside for children and adultsa,20
it has great speakers and is very easy to set up love my echo,20
my niece and nephew are going to love this i got it for a great price too what a nice christmas present,20
great screen resolution and easy to use battery life is really good,20
this product is amazing i wasn t quite sure why everyone was going on and on about having one but now that it s in my house i cannot imagine life without it alexa not only answers my questions and gives me valuable information but now she controls the lights of my house for me i highly recommend this,20
for those that have prime this is almost a must have keeps all your amazon stuff in one place,20
i love this tablet for kids it s so much fun for them great buy,20
when it works it s great but for some reason it doesn t always answer me when it doesn t answer me i turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn t work at that time it was easy to set up with the phone app doesn t seem to matter where the phone is when it isn t working i ve tried close and far and in between so a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn t,20
i m not huge on kids using electronics but my son loves this when we take trips as he can play some of the downloaded games we love it for when we want to get stuff done and still want him to be occupied and this does the trick it s a little hard to navigate at first though,20
alexa walks you through every step which i found helpful,20
it takes forever to download apps i m returning it will be getting something else,20
this is the main reason why i went with amazon s echo ecosystem vs google home i bought one as a gift to my sister so i can easily videochat with my family my niece and nephew tend to fight over the echo show when they want to sing along to their favorite songs with the lyrics on the screen my only wish was that there was an hdmi out to connect it to a larger monitor huge missed opportunity in my opinion,20
the display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good probably better for reading than watching videos we didn t really get it for the games but there is a good selection wifi works well and internet browsing is fast,20
i bought this for my wife and absolutely loves it alexa is so smart and helps my wife with everything like a personal assistant,20
the display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good probably better for reading than watching videos we didn t really get it for the games but there is a good selection wifi works well and internet browsing is fast,20
nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better,20
i like it i use it everyday and so far no cons im very please,20
purchased this for year old boy and couldn t be happier,20
little putsy so far but there are continuous updates that i think will make this a great device to stay connected with family bought a second for my dad who knows he might replace his land line someday if this gets better i do think our original echo is a bit better at responding but i enjoy this one in the kitchen aka hub of the house,20
i love the cameras and the video capabilities i have set up the picture albums and can even share on facebook and messenger i like the side charger much better than front i love the size too,20
i have had kindles over the years got to have one to read my books relax,20
outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced ipad,20
my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her kindle,20
with the cover attached the battery lasts for a good long period with the cover detached which is how i use it primarily the oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand the ability to switch hands flip upside down means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book and it fits into my pants pocket again perfect for traveling the battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days but i tend to reconnect the cover at night i am assuming that helps to recharge the basic oasis battery regardless it was well worth replacing our older kindle readers with the newer oasis we bought two,20
great tablet perfect for my year old son,20
really enjoy this product love watching movies and playing games on my fire hd,20
my son just loves it and he thinks it s easy to use and the case that comes on it has saved it,20
i bought this for my mom and she loves it she said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting it s easy for her to read,20
sound quality is very good sleek design is nice,20
love my mine works great with prime and i have all my best movies,20
i love my new amazon fire tablet it s great the perfect size to fit in my purse so that i can take it with me i would definitely recommend to a friend,20
the echo show is a great accessory to any house it has a great picture on it and great sound it s simple to use my wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists also listens to music with crisp sound can ask alexa pretty much anything,20
this is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device,20
this is my th kindle and is easily the best one i ve ever had it is very comfortable to hold and is very compact i was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles it may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery,20
this is my eighth kindle some others were either lost or screen damaged i bought it as a spare current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen great price also wish i d bought two,20
she hasn t used the it yet but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine,20
love the sound i am able to plug in a lamp in a hard to reach spot since it is now voice activated,20
haven t been able to train alexa like we ve heard probably our own fault we have fun with it,20
was good price wish it had google play download on to it,20
this is a great tablet for the price amazon is doing a good job,20
i didn t think i would like the echo show especially at the price point but i tried it and love it if i could afford it and if they would add an audio port i would replace my current alexas with echo shows,20
i use this thing every night to fall asleep although alexa don t always understand me i still love the device,20
bought this tablet on sale i can look up all the things i m interested in,20
great speaker able to move around connect to ipad when watching movies love it,20
this was a christmas present the person that received it was very happy with it she has other kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones,20
this is not an upgrade by any means my three year old kindle outperformed oasis battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak two pieces to keep up with unsnaps constantly amazon customer services promises it will resolved in an update,20
this is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device,20
bought this tablet for my mom who struggles with technology the fire hd was easy to setup and has many great features she is catching on well and learning new applications daily a great value,20
no instructions on adding the memory card and how to move things to the card vs on internally,20
this fire worked great but i returned it because it was not the one i wantedbest buy took it back for a full refund with no problems best buy is alsome,20
it is a solid product great for kids i like it a lot,20
purchased one for my older son last year got this second d one for the younger one so they don t fight over them,20
i wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick i ll get flowers next time,20
it works well and sounds decent but the hub portion of this is not as easy to use as samsung,20
pleased with alexa have not used light yet i ll update after use,20
i didn t actually use as i bought for a gift my grandson already had one so we returned for a pair if d goggles,20
product is great it is easy to use and easy to set up,20
nice size very clear but randomly shuts off cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen if you watch video it buffers alot and laggs,20
this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s in but this is about cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s was not doing it for me,20
bought this tablet on sale i can look up all the things i m interested in,20
tablet is great for kids and adult use i purchased the tablet to use at school with students with disabilities the tablet holds up well holds a charge throughout the week the tablet offers games that do not require wi fi or data if you have a prime membership there are a lot of benefits when using the fire for example free apps free streaming movies music etc,20
i didn t actually use as i bought for a gift my grandson already had one so we returned for a pair if d goggles,20
easy to set up we really enjoy getting real time local weather it translates spanish very efficiently we also enjoy the music we can easily select but would appreciate a higher quality sound linking the echo to lighting is a snap highly recommended,20
the tablet is very light and streams well i only use it to stream movies and it s much ligher then an ipad so makes mobility that much better,20
great product and great service from bestbuy online,20
i love this this memory card the price was good ty,20
got this for my year old daughter and her and my three year old love it lightweight durable and loaded with books and games what really sold me on this one over the other options was the year anything guarantee that amazon offers,20

very happy with amazon not hesitating to integrate their products with third party integration crestron,20
alexa walks you through every step which i found helpful,20
i bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices my mother bought him a subscription to the abc mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on at first i was skeptical about spending the extra for the kids fire as i thought it was mainly for the case which i thought to be cheap silicon when the tablet arrived in the mail i was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick heavy duty type of foam it provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops it booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child s account the child s account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don t want them to get a hold of you can set time limits on their account to your desire you can allow and disallow any application you want to their account it comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited which i interpreted as basically prime for kids this allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want the kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate he is able to one click to any apps books games he wants to use it also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top overall i m very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the internet holds if you re not careful,20
i was very impressed with the functionality of my amazon echo very useful to have around the house and for the discounted price it a steal,20
do you spend lots of time on amazon do you like listening to music anywhere in your home this is the device for you even after a month of having the tap i m still learning what all i can do with it verbally play genre of music in the huge amazon library i even have ordered items directly from it one last feature i want to share is that it provides accurate weather information current and forecast up to a week,20
my first ebook reader read some reviews decided to go with this because of the backlight and adaptive light sometimes i have to adjust the light manually but no biggie quick and easy on the eyes,20
got this tablet for my yr old daughter and it has been great for her it s the right size for her little hands only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it apps have to be from amazon and they might not have the app you want,20
this is my second kindle have a few more items to learn but love it easy to get around the apps,20
great price great product would recommend this gift,20
my wife s old kindle stopped holding a charge so to surprise her i stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle this kindle is great its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life my wife uses it every day this is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget,20
this is my th kindle and is easily the best one i ve ever had it is very comfortable to hold and is very compact i was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles it may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery,20
i have an lg tablet but picked up this one for my dad and after messing with it for a while it s very nice i think i like it more the my lg g pad,20
bought this kindle for my grandson he loves it and it very easy to use,20
purchased this to get a lighter tablet also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery this is all around lighter thinner and easier to handle hd is a good upgrade and can t beat the price for comparable tablets with same features my wife reads on it daily and loves it i am probably going to search for another one we have the and i would like to try a if it were available i like to try different size devices to see how i adjust same way with todays phones,20
fun to use for any age just say alexa,20
i bought this tablet for my two yr old granddaughter for christmas and she loves the games and camera works great glad i got it for her,20
i had always been looking to upgrade my original kindle i love the new touch features and display on this one the size also makes it very easy to transport,20
this has been an exceptional hit for us she totally loves it,20
bought the echo first and liked it so much i bought a tap to add mobility i carry it around all the time to the garage working out etc,20
the amazon echo show is so much fun i got it for my husband for christmas and its absolutely more of a gift for myself we also got hue lights and have set it up our routines this show is so much fun we listen to the news in the morning while making coffee it wakes us up with slowly with the hue lights we listen to music while cooking dinner cant recommend it more because of this purchase i am also buying a spot we love the camera feature where you can drop in so we will continue buying these rather than the security cameras for the inside at least where we just want to say hello or see our dog,20
small and easy to use for children when traveling,20
this tablet is perfect for travel recently took it on a trip and the battery lasted the entire day with watching shows on and off on netflix great first tablet,20
i wasn t offer the warranty but i enjoy it a lot,20
absolutely love the echo show it is in my kitchen i love seeing my to do and shopping lists on there my calendar is there too plus i scroll pictures on it from my amazon prime photos love being able to get the daily news briefing from mpr every morning also use it for timing things would highly recommend it to amazon prime members got it at a great price on sale prior to christmas,20
i love my amazon fire tablet i m sure my kids will love theirs too,20
easy to use for a year old she loves it i just don t like that my amazon account is linked to her tablet,20
i use this every day on my commute great battery life no backlight but very readable with normal lighting i like the built in dictionary email yourself pdf or mobi files for easy transfers,20
we have always been nexus tablet desciples and in fact have bought of them for self and family members this one was for granddaughter to replace nexus that had gotten slow this one works better faster than the nexus it s fast easy to use perfect tablet for a child or teenager and can t beat the price very pleased with purchase,20
great tablet for web access and works well gaming no reason to spend more unless you need a larger screen,20
i enjoy alexa she reminds me of appointment and alerts me when my packages arrive,20
i was pleasantly surprised to see the kindle for sale in the store i love my kindle especially since i was able to expand the memory i love that it s portable to be honest when given the choice i find my self on my kindle over my laptop the only thing i can complain about is why in the world amazon choose s to make it nearly a miracle to find a case for its most popular model if you don t have a kindle you don t know what your missing,20
replaced my hd fire because broke screed very pleased with the large screen,20
we have sonos speakers and a honeywell lyric thermostat it took a little searching on google to get things linked now that they are linked we can play music in any room and change our home temperature by using alexa,20
i am an old traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books now i don t lose what page i was on and have more shelf space where books used to be,20
this was one of the best birthday presents i ever purchased for my husband he said he doesn t use the computer but he was on my smartphone daily viewing fb i got him a drone for christmas and he needed something to view while it is flying i researched the kindle fire and thought he could practice with it until spring he farms so isn t busy in the winter thank goodness because he is busy with his kindle for hours every day he thinks it is great and i do too because now i have my phone back,20
was gift fot my daughter she seems to enjoy very much,20
this is my second kindle fire and i have been extremely pleased with them both this second one is much more versatile and i love it,20
excellent product turns on and off supported devices by asking it live walking into a room and asking alexa to turn on a light poof it s done or locking and unlocking the front door arming and disarming my security system if you re looking to turn your house into a smarthome i strongly recommend the amazon echo plus,20
so i bought my little guys these tablets so that i could repossess my ipad love the free time app but who could ve imagined they wouldn t play netflix so now i m out the money for the tablet and still don t have my ipad back and yes i called amazon numerous times they work after the fix but the next time they go to use them they don t work again the fix takes several minutes as it s force stopping the app clearing cache then doing a hard restart then you have to wait to restart netflix oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works if it works at all,20
purchased for my father in law this was the most frustrating experience not user friendly not friendly at all stick with a name brand tablet apple samsung etc avoid this device at all costs,20
bought this tablet for my grandson and we couldn t be happier he loves it and it is easy to use created the children s account so he wouldn t be distracted by all the other goings on the internet bought this so he could play games do his school work as it links up nicely to the ixl and google class love the usage timer and the ability to lock it down i have loaded the google play store on it so we now access to many games and other apps no issues so far great buy for the money only down side i can see or in this case hear so far low sounding speaker could be a bit louder or better placed all in all you wont be disappointed in this purchase great for web page looks ups reading and playing games,20
i like being able to ask about the weather set an alarm on my phone or create a shopping list all by just asking elexia,20
i love it easy to use many different features,20
we bought this reader to replace a fire hdx that had seemed to go wonky turns out a couple of system resets and the hdx is back to normal so i get the old one she gets the new one but i can highly recommend this reader the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent,20
this tablet is perfect for my six year old s learning apps,20
i use it for everything mainly as my new alarm clock cant wait for them to open it up even more,20
this is actually for a gift second one i purchased but great priduct,20

works better than the amazon fire tablet i have better screen faster processor and bigger to boot,20
purchased as a christmas gift for my grandson he loved it,20
our entire family loves alexa and the white color looks great on our kitchen counters,20
this is a great product at a great price i would definitely recommend this to anybody especially good for college students or people that read books etc,20
i was using the original echo seldomly then i decided to get the show i use the show a lot more was simple to set up and you can make calls with video great product,20
we love this so much in our home we bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it they love watching their movies on it and playing different apps it is a really good value,20
it s a nice upgrade from the screen size is just right for small kids hands reading kindle books is much easier,20
i bought it for my son in laws birthday after they bought me one for christmas not just good for music but helpful for grandkids homework and now we can video chat with grandkids which the one year old loves,20
a great value and i love it sounds great and works,20
wife love it reads a lot and this is her go to reader,20
i received an original echo two years ago and use it in my office this year i decided to get one for the house and was amazed at all the features i hadn t taken advantage of primarily the smart home features this was great because it came with a lightbulb,20
i received an original echo two years ago and use it in my office this year i decided to get one for the house and was amazed at all the features i hadn t taken advantage of primarily the smart home features this was great because it came with a lightbulb,20
the ultimate bluetooth speaker i have multiple amazon echos and a whole echo system set up in my house i love everything amazon i can t stand apple but now i know how they feel i am a cult member of amazon lol so anyway i have been trashing this device the tap because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things i like most about the echo the only flaw of the echo is it is not portable i tried the triby but i did not like it more for little kids so on black friday the amazon tap was on super sale so i bought it the tap is smaller than i thought it was about rd the size of the echo which is perfect for portability but don t let the size fool you the sound is only short of bose when it comes to volume and sound quality important note you don t have to have an echo to use this device just the alexa app on your smart phone the tap does everything the echo does it is an amazing bluetooth speaker and it s portable automatically switches remembers different wifi areas and can be used with a hot spot the most amazing thing about the whole amazon echo system is that amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does some things even better than google now and light years ahead of siri the tap is my new favorite device it is perfect the only flaw is that it is not waterproof amazon if you are listening make the next tap waterproof,20
kid friendly great appschild can learn many things with this tablet,20
perfect size for me speaker clarity is amazing and produces a great picture,20
kids love it great christmas present even if not an apple product,20
size brightness and convenience are good the option to link with android products for messages is a little hard,20
great product but the only downside is that it did not work with my home security camera,20
i bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips,20
got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked cheaper than getting the screen replaced,20
got this for my year old granddaughter and she loves it uses it for game play homework etc mom and dad loves the parental controls not having to worry so much,20
nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity,20
it works about of the time when asking it a question,20
our entire family loves alexa and the white color looks great on our kitchen counters,20
really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter learning i do wish it had more storage and more items for kids but we do love the tablet,20
screen is really nice great for videos i would definetly recommend it,20
the color is what got me and the features was on point the screen shows a lot of different displays to share for now until the next one,20
my fire is compact and easy to use mainly used to read online books at lunch time the battery lasts much longer than previous tablet i had and charges much quicker very happy with my fire,20
got this on sale for replaces my cds must buy as long as you have prime,20
despite not being able to get one of these from amazon until late june due to apparent strong demand best buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release april well done best buy having owned several previous kindles including the most recent paperwhite model i was unprepared for how small and light this new oasis model is reading about it is one thing but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely the oasis and its battery charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest paperwhite with no case the oasis without its cover feels impossibly light at ounces size wise the oasis is nearly a square shape at about wide by tall in fact the shape is so different from traditional kindle designs that i had to compare it next to my paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size they are it s the first kindle i think i could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort for frequent travelers like me this is a key reason to buy one of these as it s extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse the screen is the first front lit kindle i ve ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the leds from any angle no dark spots no bright spots just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions the page also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface helping achieve the illusion of printed paper it s sharp and clear better than any kindle i ve used the reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart since they are held together with magnets after doing so this is where the amazon engineering team s achievements really become clear as you just won t believe how lightweight this thing is it s easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it degrees when switching the display instantly rotates and the page turn buttons also follow with the top button always used to advance the page and the bottom button always used to go backward you can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models the battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover s battery so it runs down faster if you don t have it connected to the case it s very easy to snap the reader back into its cover which allows it to recharge while you continue to read the power button and charge port are located in the upper top right corner more or less opposite from where they are on the paperwhite i find this location to be less awkward as it s easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge the back surface of the reader not the case seems to easily attract fingerprints and they are not so easy to clean off you d think that amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now it s a minor annoyance lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model s high price relative to other kindle models without ads it s vs for an ad less paperwhite is this a lot of money perhaps but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that s easy on both your arms and your eyes then i personally think it s worth it a lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit and the price reflects that is it for everyone probably not but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you ll have to wait to get one on amazon s website if you are a serious reader this device deserves a very close look i m definitely keeping mine,20
with a price tag of this is one of the low end tablets with a lot of features but is certainly worth its price tag but it definitely lacks the features and hd display of its high end variant fire hd,20
amazon keeps getting better tablet now has option to move icons set wallpaper and more with added sd card option is even better,20
we have bought two taps one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son we love the portability of the tap it s perfect for our deck our grandchildren love it too,20
easy to set up but it does not work with all phones i have samsung,20
i received an original echo two years ago and use it in my office this year i decided to get one for the house and was amazed at all the features i hadn t taken advantage of primarily the smart home features this was great because it came with a lightbulb,20
i love this this memory card the price was good ty,20
bought it for my wife and i haven t heard any complaints so i think it s great if she s happy i m happy,20
got it for few weeks but it kind of fades away from your life,20
has been very durable with kids and easy to use great product for price,20
requires too many components cameras etc stick with basics in my opinion,20
this is the best device i have found for my e books i know it can be used for a lot more but it is my library in my hand,20
video integration it s big plus for video calling kids at home and quick check who s at the door when doorbell rings,20
this does the same stuff as the traditional echo or echo dot except it has a screen if you already liked the echo s this is a good addition the addition of the screen is neat but certainly not essential you can see daily news headlines and the weather scroll across the screen you can watch any arlo or similar cameras on it you can watch youtube and amazon video as well but you ll probably just watch that on a phone tablet or tv instead,20
not too satisfied with the sound and it loses bluetooth connection no matter what phone i use either iphone or android,20
great tablet for my and year old kid friendly safe and mom and dad enjoy it as well love that it comes in a protective case reasonably priced for a great tablet the kids love,20
got it as a gift for my dad so far so good didn t not realise the special offers are ads spend more money to buy the one with out them also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection you now need wifi to connect to the store,20
the color is what got me and the features was on point the screen shows a lot of different displays to share for now until the next one,20
this tablet is great for trips just make sure you download games and shows on it first since it does not have internet the case is great for kids who are rough with technology it really takes a beating,20
purchased this for my mother for her birthday she loves it the large screen is what she wanted most,20
my wife and i love the amazon echo plus it s very easy to control the hue lights in the house that we have set up i would recommend this to anybody we love it we also play a lot of music on it,20
i would highly recommend the kindle fire for a first time user it was really very easy to learn to navigate,20
everything i expected with none of the drawbacks i have found in other tablets,20
nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better,20

great learning tool for my granddaughter she loves it,20
fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well good tablet for books and games for all the family,20

my grandson takes it on trips and he loves it it s easy to use,20
great product and i m very satisfied with it i recommend it to other people,20

this is the only one you need it s like having the dot echo and ihome all in one with a screen,20
thoroughly enjoy my new show love the scrolling pictures,20
a bargain for the price especially for the coverage of the warranty a gift for my year old granddaughter things can happen to it she absolutely loves it and pretty easy to use,20

its a lot more then we expected this is a wonderful addition to our tech life,20
love my kindle at the price it is the best value in tech right now,20
upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras sound is much better,20
great tablet for streaming good internet connection along with a nice display,20
the graphics and sound on this tablet were better than expected,20
i purchased this kindle fire for my husband and he loves it he had an older model which he loved but my dog accidentally broke it this updated version has so many new features which he loves,20
you can do some many things and the best part apps for free on amazon underground,20
what is there to say but that i love it functions well and lasts a long time,20
bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it it s so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls,20
i had an alexa but thought the show would be cool as it would allow me to link a camera to it see videos for info i wanted to look up play my prime video account it would have been a if i could see all prime shows movies on it,20
with the cover attached the battery lasts for a good long period with the cover detached which is how i use it primarily the oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand the ability to switch hands flip upside down means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book and it fits into my pants pocket again perfect for traveling the battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days but i tend to reconnect the cover at night i am assuming that helps to recharge the basic oasis battery regardless it was well worth replacing our older kindle readers with the newer oasis we bought two,20
i can see my grandchildren when i call it is a great machine,20
this is my th kindle and is easily the best one i ve ever had it is very comfortable to hold and is very compact i was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles it may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery,20
it does everything amazon and i can even see who is at the front door with arlo it doesn t do netflix or hulu but that s okay i really like the sound it fills small rooms it s easy now to video chat with nana or drop in to tell my kid s goodnight when i am working late,20
pleased with alexa have not used light yet i ll update after use,20
works like a dream use it daily phone feature is really cool like it,20
purchased for my mom in a memory care center she doesn t have to answer the phone we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us picture clarity awesome staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently doesn t replace room camera but good would give a but can t figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her anyone know,20
good price works well best buy sales associate was very helpful in selecting this product,20
bestbuy delivered this on the day of release amazon still seems to be back ordered it is a great product nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance,20
hard to use lots of ads and randomly closes apps,Negative
i habe the echo and i bought this one fort my son s room but it s not as user friendly i wish i would ve just bought the other one,Negative
i have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon i waited for minutes then i requested another code nothing then a nother one and still nothing i started to set up the device at am and by am i was fed up with it i had to step away after about hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about codes from amazon,Negative
super slow not of decent quality i would not buy another memory on it is lacking for gig i will not recommend it to anyone,Negative
i do not like this tablet one bit it has to be registered with amazon for it to function and it failed every time i finally had to resort to calling amazon s customer service also not an easy task to get it registered there seems to be glitch in the programming because when it failed again i had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered i would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company s operations programming or software,Negative
this is not like other android tablets in a bad way,Negative
not sure why but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it very disappointing,Negative
did not power up at all i am so happy that my grand niece wasn t here and doesn t know about this yet she would have been crying,Negative
the protector was not made for the fire as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent worse purchase from best buy ever,Negative
it would not load my books proper took a dozen tries erasing an dreregistering screen too dark,Negative
too bad amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool many apps dont work and the camera is not good,Negative

i waited a couple months to review giving amazon time to make this product equal to the sony dash from nearly a decade ago it isn t the screen provides nothing of value and you can t turn of amazon tips you have near zero customization can t even move the clock to the other side of the screen and something that a sony dash did nearly years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm seriously this is the biggest fail run away from this half baked amazon disaster,Negative

so i bought my little guys these tablets so that i could repossess my ipad love the free time app but who could ve imagined they wouldn t play netflix so now i m out the money for the tablet and still don t have my ipad back and yes i called amazon numerous times they work after the fix but the next time they go to use them they don t work again the fix takes several minutes as it s force stopping the app clearing cache then doing a hard restart then you have to wait to restart netflix oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works if it works at all,Negative
waste of money ask alexa a question and you are lucky if you get an answer instead of i m not sure,Negative
i think i downloaded new apps i wait to surf the web this thing is so slow to respond my old refurbished ipad is better i really only bought it to stream hulu and netflix i m not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day but i guess you get what you pay for i wanted inexpensive i got it don t buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics,Negative

worthless except as a regular echo and a poor excuse for video chat i love my echo devices bathroom pool kitchen other places where i may need hands free voice activated music and info my wife bought me the newest hottest thing i was skeptical but then thought i would use it to help on a project me alexa find videos on f drone alexa youtube is not available amazon won t directly sell chrome products youtube won t play on echo show further testing shows the video call is more limited than iphone or android apps for video so the most useful thing now is the same voice functions that my echos and dots perform unless i want to make all of my video calls and check the weather from a device i can move no more than feet from an outlet,Negative
looking at the picture and seeing it was th generation i assumed it would be a great device i had an original kindle but i stopped using it because it wasn t backlit i thought an th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not after minutes on the phone with amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that th generation is not supported with backlights i took it back to target and purchased the paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it the th generation one is smaller so i assumed that was the reason for the price difference target made the experience pleasant,Negative

i am reading positive reviews and wish i could say the same best buy is great so this is not a reflection on them just our experience with the product we have had this product for just over one month and i have had to contact amazon support perform factory resets to get content to show up and the device is poorly designed as the sd card pops out constantly which messes with drm and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the internet to fix it we are returning and spending the extra money for an ipad will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience if you just use the device for reading maybe this is for you but trying to download information to sd card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating as well as having to do factory resets so content owned already purchased on amazon would show up on the device in the library,Negative

looking at the picture and seeing it was th generation i assumed it would be a great device i had an original kindle but i stopped using it because it wasn t backlit i thought an th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not after minutes on the phone with amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that th generation is not supported with backlights i took it back to target and purchased the paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it the th generation one is smaller so i assumed that was the reason for the price difference target made the experience pleasant,Negative

i loved this tablet i did but i did not love that i was being sold ads every time i powered up i loathe even more that i would have had to pay to discontinue that feature amazon if you want dollars for the kindle fire charge it but don t under price the device and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity it is unbecoming of you i returned this item pronto,Negative

i am reading positive reviews and wish i could say the same best buy is great so this is not a reflection on them just our experience with the product we have had this product for just over one month and i have had to contact amazon support perform factory resets to get content to show up and the device is poorly designed as the sd card pops out constantly which messes with drm and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the internet to fix it we are returning and spending the extra money for an ipad will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience if you just use the device for reading maybe this is for you but trying to download information to sd card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating as well as having to do factory resets so content owned already purchased on amazon would show up on the device in the library,Negative

i am reading positive reviews and wish i could say the same best buy is great so this is not a reflection on them just our experience with the product we have had this product for just over one month and i have had to contact amazon support perform factory resets to get content to show up and the device is poorly designed as the sd card pops out constantly which messes with drm and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the internet to fix it we are returning and spending the extra money for an ipad will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience if you just use the device for reading maybe this is for you but trying to download information to sd card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating as well as having to do factory resets so content owned already purchased on amazon would show up on the device in the library,Negative

not a very responsive program very limited information program not user friendly,Negative

i am reading positive reviews and wish i could say the same best buy is great so this is not a reflection on them just our experience with the product we have had this product for just over one month and i have had to contact amazon support perform factory resets to get content to show up and the device is poorly designed as the sd card pops out constantly which messes with drm and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the internet to fix it we are returning and spending the extra money for an ipad will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience if you just use the device for reading maybe this is for you but trying to download information to sd card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating as well as having to do factory resets so content owned already purchased on amazon would show up on the device in the library,Negative
it was a bit more involved getting set up but thereafter the function is simply talking to alexia the plug adapter to turn on and off lights tv is useful and certainly worth having,Negative
i can t update facebook and a few other apps it s not what i expected,Negative

this kindle is so overloaded with apps that i will never use despite what one of best buys associates said you cannot remove any of the amazon apps the apps take up too much of the memory i have an i pad and love but bought this as a backup for work unfortunately it bogs down i also don t like that amazon wants access to too much info to set up email so i won t use this for emails either i will likely sell it on craig s list for less than half of what i paid for it,Negative

i absolutely love how u an switch from dif accounts,Neutral
there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that i have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen this means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated,Neutral

the three star review is for the situation described here not the quality of the unit i ordered this online and picked it up in store the package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory the echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package when i hooked it up however it said that the unit was registered to someone else it wasn t a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine i spoke to both amazon and target about this and neither could tell me what happened i was offered an exchange if i wished i chose to keep the original unit but i wanted to make others aware of the issue i have one theory target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for target resale and they are all registered to this person i guess i ll never know the echo itself works fine and i m very happy with it after you hook it up make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates then you should be good to go,Neutral

there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that i have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen this means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated,Neutral

i have had every version of the kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a kindle fire i replaced the first one i had in and it was everything i wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat so i got this one first of all i miss swype why get rid of it secondly i cannot put two of my favorite apps which work on my old one to work on this but lastly and most importantly every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code shimmering in the background and only turning it off and or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life and it turns itself off it seems to happen when i close a program and move to a new one aggravating and not what i expect from a product with which i have been happy in the past,Neutral

the echo was so good i ended up getting the echo show as well at first it was a device that i enjoyed using for various reasons one being that i could ask alexa to watch any youtube videos i wanted to watch then one day i asked alexa to play a video and she responded by saying google is not supported on echo show until youtube comes back as a skill the echo show probably isn t worth the extra money i d say stick with the echo if you have amazon music or spotify or the echo dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home,Neutral

at first i wanted to return this product i bought it for my yr old i decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it i dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version i also bought it so my daughter could be independent as far as the books none of them are read aloud she came maneuver the games and movies tho its an ok product tho i love amazon my daughter still likes my samsung tab better would recommend for older kids,Neutral
there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that i have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen this means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated,Neutral
bought a few kindles in the past but this time one of it came defective the port was bent and it was hard to charge but still possible comes in different color was gb enough space for kids has camera ok quality not the best but ok for pics taken by kids,Neutral
the show has some nice features but the audio quality isn t the best for the price point i got mine on sale and am just using it for a bedroom alarm clock i can read the time without my glasses i still use my sonos play to listen to my sleep playlist and ny other music unless i missed something it seems like if i set the volume low at night to listen to music to go to sleep my alarm will not be loud enough so i don t use the show for music much,Neutral

i bought of these tablets for my two youngest children they had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go but they were already familiar with the ipad since they stole mine all the time lol that made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first besides that it s a good product,Neutral
i have had every version of the kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a kindle fire i replaced the first one i had in and it was everything i wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat so i got this one first of all i miss swype why get rid of it secondly i cannot put two of my favorite apps which work on my old one to work on this but lastly and most importantly every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code shimmering in the background and only turning it off and or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life and it turns itself off it seems to happen when i close a program and move to a new one aggravating and not what i expect from a product with which i have been happy in the past,Neutral
overall it is a good tablet but i am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and amazon app store,Neutral
i love having real books but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter i wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad it also sucks that they are gig but gig is taken up by the os and advertising seriously it reads pdfs and needs a gig os lame the last thing i would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background so it s less bright on the eyes,Neutral
this item seems great on the ads but it reality it can t do nearly as much to get it to do more you have to download skills some of which work well and others of which do not some are reviewed but many are not connecting is often difficult and sometimes the password you use has to be the same as your alexa device which no body tells you i m sure with some practice this device will be fun and useful but learning to use it and sorting through the skills is a pain,Neutral

the three star review is for the situation described here not the quality of the unit i ordered this online and picked it up in store the package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory the echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package when i hooked it up however it said that the unit was registered to someone else it wasn t a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine i spoke to both amazon and target about this and neither could tell me what happened i was offered an exchange if i wished i chose to keep the original unit but i wanted to make others aware of the issue i have one theory target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for target resale and they are all registered to this person i guess i ll never know the echo itself works fine and i m very happy with it after you hook it up make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates then you should be good to go,Neutral

alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated,Neutral
this does everything your smart phone does but with a larger screen for easier browsing and input,Neutral
there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that i have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen this means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated,Neutral

i have had every version of the kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a kindle fire i replaced the first one i had in and it was everything i wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat so i got this one first of all i miss swype why get rid of it secondly i cannot put two of my favorite apps which work on my old one to work on this but lastly and most importantly every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code shimmering in the background and only turning it off and or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life and it turns itself off it seems to happen when i close a program and move to a new one aggravating and not what i expect from a product with which i have been happy in the past,Neutral

i love having real books but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter i wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad it also sucks that they are gig but gig is taken up by the os and advertising seriously it reads pdfs and needs a gig os lame the last thing i would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background so it s less bright on the eyes,Neutral
when it works it s great but for some reason it doesn t always answer me when it doesn t answer me i turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn t work at that time it was easy to set up with the phone app doesn t seem to matter where the phone is when it isn t working i ve tried close and far and in between so a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn t,Neutral

there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that i have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen this means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated,Neutral

overall it is a good tablet but i am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and amazon app store,Neutral
wish it was a bit faster loading and browsing but functions as you would expect for kid friendly product i would spend the extra money next time for a tablet designed for adults but had strong parental controls,Neutral
the show has some nice features but the audio quality isn t the best for the price point i got mine on sale and am just using it for a bedroom alarm clock i can read the time without my glasses i still use my sonos play to listen to my sleep playlist and ny other music unless i missed something it seems like if i set the volume low at night to listen to music to go to sleep my alarm will not be loud enough so i don t use the show for music much,Neutral
this item seems great on the ads but it reality it can t do nearly as much to get it to do more you have to download skills some of which work well and others of which do not some are reviewed but many are not connecting is often difficult and sometimes the password you use has to be the same as your alexa device which no body tells you i m sure with some practice this device will be fun and useful but learning to use it and sorting through the skills is a pain,Neutral

it is difficult to understand the instructions i am still working on it,Neutral
alexa may be new but i would have thought some of the simple commands she would have been able to respond to already for the amount amazon charges it should come with better instructions including what specifically to download into one s device iphone etc so as to make some apps ready to go amazon dropped the ball on this one,Neutral

you get what you pay for playtime works when it wants to went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time my son is almost he gets bored of it quickly the pros are the price and it is well protected externally,Neutral
it s a little slow and the camera isn t the best but for the price it s fine,Neutral
just an average alexa option does show a few things on screen but still limited,Neutral
all i really use it for is music the read downfall is it s not bluetooth so it has to be plugged in,Neutral
not many apps the first one was already returned no power issue after week i hope the second one is fine,Neutral
the tablet is for my son who is that being said i noticed blotches on the screen never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son i will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway the bumper is amazing,Neutral
it s neat it does what all other amazon alexis do but a little more i feel as if should still do more,Neutral
nice device good to enable drop in conversations some flash briefings but overall still a little limited in effective use of video,Neutral
in my opinion this model is too small and feels cheap and sd card slot,Neutral
it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an ipad,Neutral
not a substitute for an ipad but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage,Neutral
this tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children,Neutral

great device i use it on a regular basis good investment,Neutral
decent little tablet if you are not a game player tablet shuts down and i cant get it back on when i play games for long periods of time it s not my ipad that s for sure,Neutral
the specs are good feels solid can t stand the os too many ads you can t get rid of not as customizable as i d like if that doesn t bother you it s a good tablet for the price don t expect to run games on it not powerful enough for that,Neutral
great for first time tablet but more advanced options available,Neutral
just an average alexa option does show a few things on screen but still limited,Neutral
great value for the money however the operating system is a bit clunky constant notifications and messages to delete some can be turned off other seem to just keep appearing the reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive,Neutral
i love having real books but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter i wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad it also sucks that they are gig but gig is taken up by the os and advertising seriously it reads pdfs and needs a gig os lame the last thing i would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background so it s less bright on the eyes,Neutral
the three star review is for the situation described here not the quality of the unit i ordered this online and picked it up in store the package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory the echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package when i hooked it up however it said that the unit was registered to someone else it wasn t a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine i spoke to both amazon and target about this and neither could tell me what happened i was offered an exchange if i wished i chose to keep the original unit but i wanted to make others aware of the issue i have one theory target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for target resale and they are all registered to this person i guess i ll never know the echo itself works fine and i m very happy with it after you hook it up make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates then you should be good to go,Neutral
alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated,Neutral
i hate amazon app store nothing good in there the tablet is too slow for what i do it is good for reading only,Neutral
great device i use it on a regular basis good investment,Neutral
there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that i have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen this means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated,Neutral
it s an ok tablet because you need to have an amazon account in order to download free apps,Neutral
my year old daughter saved up to by this her brother bought the gb about a year earlier so new she needed more space the os is a bit clunky and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets but tough to beat the price speed isn t great for web or certain gaming apps but fine for books parental controls are helpful but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change overall ok first tablet for kids considering the price for adults fine for e books and very basic apps otherwise best to pay up for better quality and os efficiency,Neutral
in my opinion it s very slow for internet use good for our yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house,Neutral
good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets it s limited to amazon so don t expect to do as much as an android or ipad i like mine and will continue to use it i recommend using one if you can before buying,Neutral
the display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good probably better for reading than watching videos we didn t really get it for the games but there is a good selection wifi works well and internet browsing is fast,Neutral
at first i wanted to return this product i bought it for my yr old i decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it i dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version i also bought it so my daughter could be independent as far as the books none of them are read aloud she came maneuver the games and movies tho its an ok product tho i love amazon my daughter still likes my samsung tab better would recommend for older kids,Neutral
i loved this thing until it was time to go to bed although it dims the lowest setting is still very bright like sleeping with a flashlight in your face i hope they make fixes that will allow the screen to dim more also not crazy about having a camera connected to the internet on my nightstand if you cover it up the motion sensor then won t work the sound is ok not quite as good as the non screen echo maybe because it s not omni directional like the regular echo my enthusiasm for this device has subsided quite a bit because of these issues,Neutral
i was completely under the impression that this tablet was child friendly but there are no built in restrictions so my son was able to purchase numerous apps and movies my son usually uses my wife s ipad so i thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child if you buy this tablet immediately change the settings to require a pin to make purchases i think the age recommendation should be not,Neutral
great beginner tablet for kids i would recommend it,Neutral

limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do,Neutral
alexa may be new but i would have thought some of the simple commands she would have been able to respond to already for the amount amazon charges it should come with better instructions including what specifically to download into one s device iphone etc so as to make some apps ready to go amazon dropped the ball on this one,Neutral

i have had every version of the kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a kindle fire i replaced the first one i had in and it was everything i wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat so i got this one first of all i miss swype why get rid of it secondly i cannot put two of my favorite apps which work on my old one to work on this but lastly and most importantly every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code shimmering in the background and only turning it off and or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life and it turns itself off it seems to happen when i close a program and move to a new one aggravating and not what i expect from a product with which i have been happy in the past,Neutral
great for first time tablet but more advanced options available,Neutral
worse graphics won t keep a wireless connection overall not satisfied,Neutral
i ll give it starts because it s a decent tablet but if the screen messes up when i m trying to use it i can t imagine how my granddaughter feels,Neutral

in my opinion this model is too small and feels cheap and sd card slot,Neutral
it s unfair for me to rate this product cause i have not even taken it out of the box to set it up,Neutral
this does everything your smart phone does but with a larger screen for easier browsing and input,Neutral
it s great for beginners like children but very limiting for me i can t use many apps because it doesn t allow me to use the google play store,Neutral
the tablet is pretty good i would give it stars if you are able to download an use apps from the google store that is one of my only big complaint and also how fast the sd card got filled with items from amazon os that s on the tablet without the user knowing on the other hand with four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful,Neutral
great sound easy set up the screen seems sort of wasteful now that i ve been playing with it maybe it has the capability to work as a digital picture frame i m just certain yet i was able to set one picture to it not multiple would be nice if could be used for hulu or netflix and stuff since the picture and sound are so clear i like the visual to do and shopping lists still worth the purchase a good want to have just not a must have then again maybe i have not tapped into all it can do,Neutral
it was a cool device but my main issue that it couldn t play playlists the i had stored on the sonos app it only played streaming services,Neutral

i bought it cause i wanted to read more that didn t happen i tried and i just can t read on devices i need old school paper between my hands,Neutral
this product while the speaker is great fails to deliver with a voice interface use your cell phone or computer and buy an echo dot,Neutral

we wanted to see how this would work and it s not super accurate but kind of fun,Neutral
i like my show but i can t say i love it for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices it has probably the worst microphone getting it to respond is frustrating at times where i have no problem with a standard echo besides this it all works as advertised i d wait for the second generation i m sure they can work the kinks out,Neutral
the echo was so good i ended up getting the echo show as well at first it was a device that i enjoyed using for various reasons one being that i could ask alexa to watch any youtube videos i wanted to watch then one day i asked alexa to play a video and she responded by saying google is not supported on echo show until youtube comes back as a skill the echo show probably isn t worth the extra money i d say stick with the echo if you have amazon music or spotify or the echo dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home,Neutral

i m not a techie but after days of trying to hook up i gave up i don t know if it was the echo plus or my carrier att uverse causing the issue but it would not connect so back to the store it went even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistance none of it worked,Neutral

the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped took back and got a replacement this one lasted almost a month again took it back and was told i had to deal with amazon found out thru amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product had to research everything myself,Neutral
the tablet works fine it is responsive with good resolution it is too tied to amazon it requires too many hoops to get apps such as zinio to work until amazon loosens its grip i recommend only at a very good price,Neutral
like the alexa but needs to be more interactive like suri,Neutral

this tablet is a good kids tablet and or for prime users not a laptop replacement or for non amazon users,Neutral
speaker is pretty loud and i love that i can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the home button to use alexa,Neutral
its a great product but for the cost the speakers are not what they should be and the screen is too small choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot i am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance,Neutral
is a god tablet but the camera could be a little better,Neutral

great sound easy set up the screen seems sort of wasteful now that i ve been playing with it maybe it has the capability to work as a digital picture frame i m just certain yet i was able to set one picture to it not multiple would be nice if could be used for hulu or netflix and stuff since the picture and sound are so clear i like the visual to do and shopping lists still worth the purchase a good want to have just not a must have then again maybe i have not tapped into all it can do,Neutral
the sound quality is good alexa responds to commands but their is room for improvement,Neutral
my year old daughter saved up to by this her brother bought the gb about a year earlier so new she needed more space the os is a bit clunky and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets but tough to beat the price speed isn t great for web or certain gaming apps but fine for books parental controls are helpful but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change overall ok first tablet for kids considering the price for adults fine for e books and very basic apps otherwise best to pay up for better quality and os efficiency,Neutral
it was great product the price which i got it was great,Neutral
not many apps the first one was already returned no power issue after week i hope the second one is fine,Neutral
i was not a fan of the amazon type operating system that is on the tablet ended up taking it back because it was not what i wanted not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an android tablet,Neutral
much better than the echo dot however the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying speaker is fairly powerful for its size,Neutral
this does the same things as the other echos but has a screen the sound is comparable to the echo which is good the screen is small not hd and not touch screen you only can call other echo users if you have an echo don t run out and buy you can do all on a laptop if you are looking at an echo having the screen might be worth the extra bucks,Neutral
this device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual,Neutral
good tablet for kids lots of appts to download for games,Neutral

there s not much difference in the regular kindle wait till it goes on sale,Neutral
i bought this as a christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it it hasn t been working as it should and its only been a little over months since she s had it i m going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps,Neutral
you get what you pay for playtime works when it wants to went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time my son is almost he gets bored of it quickly the pros are the price and it is well protected externally,Neutral
i didn t do any in depth research on this particular tablet the price and speed were good for what i wanted it for my only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so i can see my personal home screen picture,Neutral
nothing too special or complicated fills the need,Neutral
only download was very slow and echo show didn t make it worth having as a stand alone,Neutral

its a decent reader for beginners there is no backlight so not good for reading in dark also slips from hands so purchase a cover if you buy it,Neutral
this does everything your smart phone does but with a larger screen for easier browsing and input,Neutral
the echo show works well but at this time it cannot connect to youtube maybe when amazon wakes up the connection will be returned,Neutral
i had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to amazon,Neutral

for me the kindle black was not a good fit for me there are times i read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping this model doesn t have a back light so i m unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband so i returned and went for a kindle fire,Neutral
i got this to work with my arlo pro camera and it works well i am able to have my camera for driveway and front door come up on command i hate that i cannot get my samsung tv to come on with a verbal request i guess i will have to buy the plug for it this was very easy to set up downloaded the app and plugged it in viola it walks you through the setup,Neutral
just an average alexa option does show a few things on screen but still limited,Neutral
very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don t work very well charging port very low quality,Neutral
great purchase for a year old girl easy way for peaceful long car rides,Neutral
much harder to work than an android none of the wallpaper apps i downloaded from the kindle store work on the device many of the other apps look cheap on the display other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper tablet they make it look like an android tablet but it is not no google play everything is just harder to work than on a regular android but for a tablet under it exceeds expectations it is more responsive than other models of fire,Neutral

this is my first experience with alexa hard to command i guess because this is my first time i did have to reset because she stopped working i am reading up on alexa more so i ll know how to command her,Neutral
i wouldn t buy it again the software doesn t seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine i also have an echo and i don t have the same connectivity issues with it that i do with this i liked the features available with this portability mainly with a long battery life but with plagued by connectivity issues i can t say i would recommend it i have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered i am not the only one that feels this way the sound when it is connected and responding is amazing,Neutral
bought a few kindles in the past but this time one of it came defective the port was bent and it was hard to charge but still possible comes in different color was gb enough space for kids has camera ok quality not the best but ok for pics taken by kids,Neutral

at first i wanted to return this product i bought it for my yr old i decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it i dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version i also bought it so my daughter could be independent as far as the books none of them are read aloud she came maneuver the games and movies tho its an ok product tho i love amazon my daughter still likes my samsung tab better would recommend for older kids,Neutral
upgraded my year old kindle same old doesnt seem that great of a difference the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading,Neutral
i love having real books but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter i wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad it also sucks that they are gig but gig is taken up by the os and advertising seriously it reads pdfs and needs a gig os lame the last thing i would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background so it s less bright on the eyes,Neutral
i returned it because i wanted better sound opted for a bose soundlink decent speaker with nice amazon prime alexa features just not the sound i was looking for,Neutral
i was completely under the impression that this tablet was child friendly but there are no built in restrictions so my son was able to purchase numerous apps and movies my son usually uses my wife s ipad so i thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child if you buy this tablet immediately change the settings to require a pin to make purchases i think the age recommendation should be not,Neutral
you get what you pay for was not to happy but for a year old it s ok,Neutral
not happy at first as battery was totally dead when i got it however after charging it s working ok,Neutral
it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an ipad,Neutral
i ll give it starts because it s a decent tablet but if the screen messes up when i m trying to use it i can t imagine how my granddaughter feels,Neutral
i love these tablets but the charging ports aren t the best i bought for christmas and my kids take excellent care of them i also do not them touch the tablets while they are charging they have only had their tablets since christmas day and they won t charge i highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item,Neutral
worse graphics won t keep a wireless connection overall not satisfied,Neutral
i purchased this since i bought my grandson this tablet for christmas the tablet is slow considering price that s ok i have problems with the charger it won t charge when i am using the tablet the charger needs to be plugged in and not moved for it to charge for the price the tablet is ok,Neutral
its a great product but for the cost the speakers are not what they should be and the screen is too small choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot i am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance,Neutral

there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that i have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen this means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated,Neutral

the three star review is for the situation described here not the quality of the unit i ordered this online and picked it up in store the package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory the echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package when i hooked it up however it said that the unit was registered to someone else it wasn t a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine i spoke to both amazon and target about this and neither could tell me what happened i was offered an exchange if i wished i chose to keep the original unit but i wanted to make others aware of the issue i have one theory target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for target resale and they are all registered to this person i guess i ll never know the echo itself works fine and i m very happy with it after you hook it up make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates then you should be good to go,Neutral
only download was very slow and echo show didn t make it worth having as a stand alone,Neutral
this does the same things as the other echos but has a screen the sound is comparable to the echo which is good the screen is small not hd and not touch screen you only can call other echo users if you have an echo don t run out and buy you can do all on a laptop if you are looking at an echo having the screen might be worth the extra bucks,Neutral
great value for the money however the operating system is a bit clunky constant notifications and messages to delete some can be turned off other seem to just keep appearing the reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive,Neutral

much better than the echo dot however the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying speaker is fairly powerful for its size,Neutral

i loved this thing until it was time to go to bed although it dims the lowest setting is still very bright like sleeping with a flashlight in your face i hope they make fixes that will allow the screen to dim more also not crazy about having a camera connected to the internet on my nightstand if you cover it up the motion sensor then won t work the sound is ok not quite as good as the non screen echo maybe because it s not omni directional like the regular echo my enthusiasm for this device has subsided quite a bit because of these issues,Neutral
the tablet is pretty good i would give it stars if you are able to download an use apps from the google store that is one of my only big complaint and also how fast the sd card got filled with items from amazon os that s on the tablet without the user knowing on the other hand with four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful,Neutral

great product but the only downside is that it did not work with my home security camera,Neutral
its a great product but for the cost the speakers are not what they should be and the screen is too small choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot i am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance,Neutral
the sound quality is good alexa responds to commands but their is room for improvement,Neutral

alexa may be new but i would have thought some of the simple commands she would have been able to respond to already for the amount amazon charges it should come with better instructions including what specifically to download into one s device iphone etc so as to make some apps ready to go amazon dropped the ball on this one,Neutral

there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that i have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen this means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated,Neutral

great beginner tablet for kids i would recommend it,Neutral
the kindle is great for just reading books and the battery power is pretty good the experimental browser is not very user friendly,Neutral
much better than the echo dot however the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying speaker is fairly powerful for its size,Neutral
much harder to work than an android none of the wallpaper apps i downloaded from the kindle store work on the device many of the other apps look cheap on the display other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper tablet they make it look like an android tablet but it is not no google play everything is just harder to work than on a regular android but for a tablet under it exceeds expectations it is more responsive than other models of fire,Neutral
good tablet for kids lots of appts to download for games,Neutral
i purchase this at the store and i was not given any bulb till i decide to do review,Neutral

i returned it because i wanted better sound opted for a bose soundlink decent speaker with nice amazon prime alexa features just not the sound i was looking for,Neutral
the show has some nice features but the audio quality isn t the best for the price point i got mine on sale and am just using it for a bedroom alarm clock i can read the time without my glasses i still use my sonos play to listen to my sleep playlist and ny other music unless i missed something it seems like if i set the volume low at night to listen to music to go to sleep my alarm will not be loud enough so i don t use the show for music much,Neutral
i m disappointed sometimes gives doesn t understand,Neutral
very helpful and friendly didn t have too much selection on what i was looking for but found what i needed,Neutral
limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do,Neutral
alexa may be new but i would have thought some of the simple commands she would have been able to respond to already for the amount amazon charges it should come with better instructions including what specifically to download into one s device iphone etc so as to make some apps ready to go amazon dropped the ball on this one,Neutral
the kindle is great for just reading books and the battery power is pretty good the experimental browser is not very user friendly,Neutral
i had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to amazon,Neutral
when i tried to hook it up it wouldn t recognize my internet i will have to contact best buy when i get home and have their guys come out to see if they can get it working,Neutral
i bought this as a gift to my parents the unfortunate part was that i was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that i purchases as well as part of the gift the tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing other than that it s an alright product,Neutral
great for first time tablet but more advanced options available,Neutral

the sound quality is good alexa responds to commands but their is room for improvement,Neutral
when i first bought it and got it started it wouldn t register my amazon account i tried making a new account and i tried using my moms account but it would not work so i took it back and had geek squad look at it and they claimed it was defective and exchanged it for another one and the new one works wonderfully haven t had any issues with it yet,Neutral
i hate amazon app store nothing good in there the tablet is too slow for what i do it is good for reading only,Neutral
i bought this because the package said it was a fast charger only to find it charges at normal speed that was disappointing i m pretty sure i m not doing anything wrong it seems pretty self explanatory,Neutral
works fine on wifi otherwise a little slow my kid enjoys it though for the price it s good,Neutral
its a decent reader for beginners there is no backlight so not good for reading in dark also slips from hands so purchase a cover if you buy it,Neutral
now that now how to set it up i love my alexia lights,Neutral
i love these tablets but the charging ports aren t the best i bought for christmas and my kids take excellent care of them i also do not them touch the tablets while they are charging they have only had their tablets since christmas day and they won t charge i highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item,Neutral
very small in size not exactly what i had thought but yet good product for the price i paid,Neutral
very helpful for someone with disabilities saves a lot steps responsive and fun to use,Neutral
this item seems great on the ads but it reality it can t do nearly as much to get it to do more you have to download skills some of which work well and others of which do not some are reviewed but many are not connecting is often difficult and sometimes the password you use has to be the same as your alexa device which no body tells you i m sure with some practice this device will be fun and useful but learning to use it and sorting through the skills is a pain,Neutral
when i tried to hook it up it wouldn t recognize my internet i will have to contact best buy when i get home and have their guys come out to see if they can get it working,Neutral
there s not much difference in the regular kindle wait till it goes on sale,Neutral

very small in size not exactly what i had thought but yet good product for the price i paid,Neutral
in my opinion it s very slow for internet use good for our yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house,Neutral
very helpful and friendly didn t have too much selection on what i was looking for but found what i needed,Neutral
the three star review is for the situation described here not the quality of the unit i ordered this online and picked it up in store the package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory the echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package when i hooked it up however it said that the unit was registered to someone else it wasn t a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine i spoke to both amazon and target about this and neither could tell me what happened i was offered an exchange if i wished i chose to keep the original unit but i wanted to make others aware of the issue i have one theory target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for target resale and they are all registered to this person i guess i ll never know the echo itself works fine and i m very happy with it after you hook it up make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates then you should be good to go,Neutral
this product while the speaker is great fails to deliver with a voice interface use your cell phone or computer and buy an echo dot,Neutral
i m a big fan of amazon and their products but this tablet is just ok the build quality is great and the image is very good but the software is mediocre at best worth the price,Neutral
i own an echo and the tap the tap is slower to respond if you haven t used the echo then you will like the tap,Neutral
the specs are good feels solid can t stand the os too many ads you can t get rid of not as customizable as i d like if that doesn t bother you it s a good tablet for the price don t expect to run games on it not powerful enough for that,Neutral

not a substitute for an ipad but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage,Neutral
i bought of these tablets for my two youngest children they had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go but they were already familiar with the ipad since they stole mine all the time lol that made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first besides that it s a good product,Neutral
have just started using alexa and am looking forward to all the other things that are available to use with the unit,Neutral
i was not a fan of the amazon type operating system that is on the tablet ended up taking it back because it was not what i wanted not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an android tablet,Neutral
great value for the money however the operating system is a bit clunky constant notifications and messages to delete some can be turned off other seem to just keep appearing the reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive,Neutral
when i tried to hook it up it wouldn t recognize my internet i will have to contact best buy when i get home and have their guys come out to see if they can get it working,Neutral
it has great durability but lacks great sound the picture quality is just ok,Neutral
i absolutely love how u an switch from dif accounts,Neutral
it is difficult to understand the instructions i am still working on it,Neutral
its a great product but for the cost the speakers are not what they should be and the screen is too small choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot i am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance,Neutral
i own an echo and the tap the tap is slower to respond if you haven t used the echo then you will like the tap,Neutral

i wouldn t buy it again the software doesn t seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine i also have an echo and i don t have the same connectivity issues with it that i do with this i liked the features available with this portability mainly with a long battery life but with plagued by connectivity issues i can t say i would recommend it i have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered i am not the only one that feels this way the sound when it is connected and responding is amazing,Neutral
you get what you pay for playtime works when it wants to went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time my son is almost he gets bored of it quickly the pros are the price and it is well protected externally,Neutral
i got this to work with my arlo pro camera and it works well i am able to have my camera for driveway and front door come up on command i hate that i cannot get my samsung tv to come on with a verbal request i guess i will have to buy the plug for it this was very easy to set up downloaded the app and plugged it in viola it walks you through the setup,Neutral
there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that i have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen this means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated,Neutral
the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped took back and got a replacement this one lasted almost a month again took it back and was told i had to deal with amazon found out thru amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product had to research everything myself,Neutral
meh it works i find it difficult to navigate i also have an ipad mini this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad,Neutral

the echo was so good i ended up getting the echo show as well at first it was a device that i enjoyed using for various reasons one being that i could ask alexa to watch any youtube videos i wanted to watch then one day i asked alexa to play a video and she responded by saying google is not supported on echo show until youtube comes back as a skill the echo show probably isn t worth the extra money i d say stick with the echo if you have amazon music or spotify or the echo dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home,Neutral

i was not a fan of the amazon type operating system that is on the tablet ended up taking it back because it was not what i wanted not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an android tablet,Neutral
this does the same things as the other echos but has a screen the sound is comparable to the echo which is good the screen is small not hd and not touch screen you only can call other echo users if you have an echo don t run out and buy you can do all on a laptop if you are looking at an echo having the screen might be worth the extra bucks,Neutral
my daughter has had this tablet for almost months and it works well,Neutral

great purchase for a year old girl easy way for peaceful long car rides,Neutral
great sound easy set up the screen seems sort of wasteful now that i ve been playing with it maybe it has the capability to work as a digital picture frame i m just certain yet i was able to set one picture to it not multiple would be nice if could be used for hulu or netflix and stuff since the picture and sound are so clear i like the visual to do and shopping lists still worth the purchase a good want to have just not a must have then again maybe i have not tapped into all it can do,Neutral
the display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good probably better for reading than watching videos we didn t really get it for the games but there is a good selection wifi works well and internet browsing is fast,Neutral
worse graphics won t keep a wireless connection overall not satisfied,Neutral
alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated,Neutral
i purchased this to download books for school screen too small and os was not to my liking,Neutral
this tablet is great for books audible books music and all things amazon the included browser silk is not the best i purchased expanded memory gb sd card for about more and a cover for about the biggest issue i have with this unit is that it is slow when compared to an ipad and it tends to freeze every so often for about x more money consider an ipad instead,Neutral

the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale,Neutral
i only bought this as a travel companion when i fly it was cheap and functional,Neutral
the three star review is for the situation described here not the quality of the unit i ordered this online and picked it up in store the package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory the echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package when i hooked it up however it said that the unit was registered to someone else it wasn t a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine i spoke to both amazon and target about this and neither could tell me what happened i was offered an exchange if i wished i chose to keep the original unit but i wanted to make others aware of the issue i have one theory target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for target resale and they are all registered to this person i guess i ll never know the echo itself works fine and i m very happy with it after you hook it up make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates then you should be good to go,Neutral
there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that i have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen this means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated,Neutral
my daughter has had this tablet for almost months and it works well,Neutral

the show has some nice features but the audio quality isn t the best for the price point i got mine on sale and am just using it for a bedroom alarm clock i can read the time without my glasses i still use my sonos play to listen to my sleep playlist and ny other music unless i missed something it seems like if i set the volume low at night to listen to music to go to sleep my alarm will not be loud enough so i don t use the show for music much,Neutral
is a god tablet but the camera could be a little better,Neutral
the kindle is great for just reading books and the battery power is pretty good the experimental browser is not very user friendly,Neutral
not happy at first as battery was totally dead when i got it however after charging it s working ok,Neutral
this does the same things as the other echos but has a screen the sound is comparable to the echo which is good the screen is small not hd and not touch screen you only can call other echo users if you have an echo don t run out and buy you can do all on a laptop if you are looking at an echo having the screen might be worth the extra bucks,Neutral
good tablet for kids lots of appts to download for games,Neutral
the sleek design and colors available for small kids is good the tablet is a nice price and useful,Neutral
i bought this as a gift to my parents the unfortunate part was that i was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that i purchases as well as part of the gift the tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing other than that it s an alright product,Neutral
i like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k,Neutral
i bought it cause i wanted to read more that didn t happen i tried and i just can t read on devices i need old school paper between my hands,Neutral
i love having real books but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter i wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad it also sucks that they are gig but gig is taken up by the os and advertising seriously it reads pdfs and needs a gig os lame the last thing i would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background so it s less bright on the eyes,Neutral
this tablet is a good kids tablet and or for prime users not a laptop replacement or for non amazon users,Neutral
this does the same things as the other echos but has a screen the sound is comparable to the echo which is good the screen is small not hd and not touch screen you only can call other echo users if you have an echo don t run out and buy you can do all on a laptop if you are looking at an echo having the screen might be worth the extra bucks,Neutral
its a decent reader for beginners there is no backlight so not good for reading in dark also slips from hands so purchase a cover if you buy it,Neutral
overall it is a good tablet but i am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and amazon app store,Neutral
the specs are good feels solid can t stand the os too many ads you can t get rid of not as customizable as i d like if that doesn t bother you it s a good tablet for the price don t expect to run games on it not powerful enough for that,Neutral

nothing too special or complicated fills the need,Neutral
i have a paper white and honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value i certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money to note it operates great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest,Neutral
the kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading,Neutral
there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that i have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen this means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated,Neutral
no instructions either paper or electronic how do i transfer apps data from old kindle to new one,Neutral
these are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft yet bulky a good thing in this instance case the only thing i wish was that it could access the google play store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our google play movies account,Neutral
the echo show feels useless after a few hours especially without the ability to watch youtube,Neutral
have just started using alexa and am looking forward to all the other things that are available to use with the unit,Neutral
hoped this fire hd would be faster than my old hd fire not so much i guess i expected the new fire hd to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the internet my wife s ipad is light years ahead on this one but what do you expect from a dollar tablet,Neutral
i like my show but i can t say i love it for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices it has probably the worst microphone getting it to respond is frustrating at times where i have no problem with a standard echo besides this it all works as advertised i d wait for the second generation i m sure they can work the kinks out,Neutral
i like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k,Neutral
it s neat it does what all other amazon alexis do but a little more i feel as if should still do more,Neutral
i bought this because the package said it was a fast charger only to find it charges at normal speed that was disappointing i m pretty sure i m not doing anything wrong it seems pretty self explanatory,Neutral
it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an ipad,Neutral
this does everything your smart phone does but with a larger screen for easier browsing and input,Neutral
this is my first experience with alexa hard to command i guess because this is my first time i did have to reset because she stopped working i am reading up on alexa more so i ll know how to command her,Neutral
i love these tablets but the charging ports aren t the best i bought for christmas and my kids take excellent care of them i also do not them touch the tablets while they are charging they have only had their tablets since christmas day and they won t charge i highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item,Neutral
it was great product the price which i got it was great,Neutral
wish it was easier to understand set up so children don t accidently charge to my account,Neutral
it s unfair for me to rate this product cause i have not even taken it out of the box to set it up,Neutral
i was hoping to use google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen still cheap and fine for watching movies,Neutral
its a decent reader for beginners there is no backlight so not good for reading in dark also slips from hands so purchase a cover if you buy it,Neutral
i purchased this since i bought my grandson this tablet for christmas the tablet is slow considering price that s ok i have problems with the charger it won t charge when i am using the tablet the charger needs to be plugged in and not moved for it to charge for the price the tablet is ok,Neutral
decent somewhat slow netflix freezes up at times,Neutral
great purchase for a year old girl easy way for peaceful long car rides,Neutral
i was completely under the impression that this tablet was child friendly but there are no built in restrictions so my son was able to purchase numerous apps and movies my son usually uses my wife s ipad so i thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child if you buy this tablet immediately change the settings to require a pin to make purchases i think the age recommendation should be not,Neutral
the three star review is for the situation described here not the quality of the unit i ordered this online and picked it up in store the package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory the echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package when i hooked it up however it said that the unit was registered to someone else it wasn t a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine i spoke to both amazon and target about this and neither could tell me what happened i was offered an exchange if i wished i chose to keep the original unit but i wanted to make others aware of the issue i have one theory target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for target resale and they are all registered to this person i guess i ll never know the echo itself works fine and i m very happy with it after you hook it up make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates then you should be good to go,Neutral
wish it was a bit faster loading and browsing but functions as you would expect for kid friendly product i would spend the extra money next time for a tablet designed for adults but had strong parental controls,Neutral
it s ok but i rather have bought samsung galaxy tab,Neutral

i like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k,Neutral
i didn t do any in depth research on this particular tablet the price and speed were good for what i wanted it for my only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so i can see my personal home screen picture,Neutral
they make it seem like you can pretty much ask anything to alexa but she never knows anything it is very non responsive at times too,Neutral
clear reading in bright light outdoor settings long battery life,Neutral
i wouldn t buy it again the software doesn t seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine i also have an echo and i don t have the same connectivity issues with it that i do with this i liked the features available with this portability mainly with a long battery life but with plagued by connectivity issues i can t say i would recommend it i have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered i am not the only one that feels this way the sound when it is connected and responding is amazing,Neutral
not easy to navigate and download apps to the device,Neutral
it has very limited use without adding on expensive apps or adding more wireless speakers i am considering returning the merchandise,Neutral
the echo was so good i ended up getting the echo show as well at first it was a device that i enjoyed using for various reasons one being that i could ask alexa to watch any youtube videos i wanted to watch then one day i asked alexa to play a video and she responded by saying google is not supported on echo show until youtube comes back as a skill the echo show probably isn t worth the extra money i d say stick with the echo if you have amazon music or spotify or the echo dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home,Neutral
only download was very slow and echo show didn t make it worth having as a stand alone,Neutral
requires too many components cameras etc stick with basics in my opinion,Neutral
decent somewhat slow netflix freezes up at times,Neutral
